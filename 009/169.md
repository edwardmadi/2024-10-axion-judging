# Missing validation for tick bounds in `setTickBounds` function

### Summary

missing check for `tickLower < tickUpper` in the `setTickBounds()` function allows invalid tick ranges to be set, which can lead to unintended behavior and potential protocol issues. Without this validation, `tickLower` could be greater than `tickUpper`, causing faulty logic in subsequent processes.

### Root Cause

In [SolidlyV3AMO.sol:86](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV3AMO.sol#L86), there is no validation to ensure that tickLower is less than tickUpper in the setTickBounds() function

### Internal pre-conditions

`SETTER_ROLE` needs to set `setTickBounds()` with invalid tick values where tickLower >= tickUpper

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- `SETTER_ROLE` calls `setTickBounds()` and sets `tickLower` to be greater than tickUpper.
- Protocol behaves incorrectly, potentially causing loss of funds or other unintended behavior.

### Impact

The protocol suffers from faulty logic due to invalid tick bounds, which may lead to improper liquidity allocation or even financial losses.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Add a validation check within setTickBounds() to ensure tickLower is always less than tickUpper:

```solidity
require(tickLower_ < tickUpper_, "Invalid tick range");
```
