# Missing `_authorizeUpgrade` Function

### Summary

The `BoostStablecoin`, `MasterAMO`, and`Minter` contracts are vulnerable to unauthorized upgrades due to the absence of the `_authorizeUpgrade` function, which should restrict upgrade operations to the contract owner or an authorized party. Without this function, the upgradeability mechanism becomes insecure, allowing potential unauthorized actors to upgrade the contract and alter its core functionality.
