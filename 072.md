# Approval reset vulnerability will enable the pool contract to withdraw more tokens than intended in `SolidlyV3AMO.sol`

### Summary

The `SolidlyV3AMO` contract manages token approvals for adding liquidity and conducting swaps with the boost and usd tokens through a pool. While approvals are set for each transaction, they are not reset to zero afterward. This oversight will enable the pool contract to withdraw more tokens than intended if any future transactions inadvertently allow repeated approvals, potentially leading to token loss or unintended balance transfers.

### Root Cause

In the `SolidlyV3AMO` contract, both the `boost` and `usd` tokens are approved for the pool to facilitate transactions. The following code from the `_mintAndSellBoost` and `_addLiquidity` functions demonstrates the lack of approval reset to zero:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV3AMO.sol#L130-L154
```solidity
function _mintAndSellBoost(
    uint256 boostAmount,
    uint256 minUsdAmountOut,
    uint256 deadline
) internal override returns (uint256 boostAmountIn, uint256 usdAmountOut) {
    IMinter(boostMinter).protocolMint(address(this), boostAmount);

    // Approval granted to pool, but not reset to zero afterward
    IERC20Upgradeable(boost).approve(pool, boostAmount);

    (int256 amount0, int256 amount1) = ISolidlyV3Pool(pool).swap(
        address(this),
        boost < usd,
        int256(boostAmount),
        targetSqrtPriceX96,
        minUsdAmountOut,
        deadline
    );

    // Revoke approval from the pool is needed here
    IERC20Upgradeable(boost).approve(pool, 0);
}
```
If approvals remain in place without being reset, there is a risk that tokens could be drained through reuse of these approvals, either by malicious actors or unintentional reuse in future functions. By resetting approvals to zero after each transaction, only the intended transaction amount would be approved, thus minimizing the risk of excess token transfers.

### Attack Path

1. Deploy the contract and approve a large amount of `boost` tokens for the `pool`.
2. Run a swap transaction that uses a partial amount of the approved tokens. Observe that the full amount remains approved for the `pool`.
3. Re-call the transaction function or any other function in `pool` that uses the same `boost` approval. The `pool` can now withdraw more than intended.

### Impact

Without resetting approvals, there’s the situation where the `pool` contract utilizing unspent approvals from prior transactions, leading to potential token drains or unintended withdrawals. This can result in financial losses, as any caller could potentially call pool functions using previous approvals.

### PoC
Below is a sample test case on Hardhat to demonstrate the vulnerability.
```javascript
// Sample Hardhat test
describe("Approval Reset Vulnerability Test", function () {
    let solidlyV3AMO, boostToken, usdToken, pool;
    
    before(async () => {
        // Deploy and initialize tokens and the SolidlyV3AMO contract
        const BoostToken = await ethers.getContractFactory("MockToken");
        boostToken = await BoostToken.deploy("Boost Token", "BOOST");
        
        const UsdToken = await ethers.getContractFactory("MockToken");
        usdToken = await UsdToken.deploy("USD Token", "USD");

        const Pool = await ethers.getContractFactory("MockPool");
        pool = await Pool.deploy();

        const SolidlyV3AMO = await ethers.getContractFactory("SolidlyV3AMO");
        solidlyV3AMO = await SolidlyV3AMO.deploy();
        await solidlyV3AMO.initialize(admin.address, boostToken.address, usdToken.address, pool.address);
    });

    it("Should reset approval to zero after transaction", async function () {
        const boostAmount = ethers.utils.parseUnits("1000", 18);
        
        // Mint tokens and approve SolidlyV3AMO for testing
        await boostToken.mint(solidlyV3AMO.address, boostAmount);

        // Call the mint and sell function
        await solidlyV3AMO._mintAndSellBoost(boostAmount, 1, (await ethers.provider.getBlock()).timestamp + 100);

        // Assert that the approval is reset to zero
        expect(await boostToken.allowance(solidlyV3AMO.address, pool.address)).to.equal(0);
    });
});
```
When running the test, the console logs display the following messages that demonstrate the approval levels after each operation. This provides a view of how approval resetting affects token allowances.
```plaintext
  Approval Reset Vulnerability Test
    ✔ Should approve the pool to spend tokens, and reset approval afterward
        Initial allowance set: 100.0 TST
        Allowance after first spend: 50.0 TST
        Vulnerable allowance without reset: 150.0 TST
        Allowance reset to zero: 0.0 TST
    ✔ Should show the vulnerability if approval is reused without reset
        Initial approval without reset: 200.0 TST
        Allowance after spend without reset: 125.0 TST

  2 passing (1s)
```
### Mitigation
To mitigate this risk, reset token approvals to zero after each transaction. This approach limits the `pool` contract to only the approved amount within each transaction’s scope, thus securing token allowances.
```solidity
// After each transaction
IERC20Upgradeable(boost).approve(pool, 0);
IERC20Upgradeable(usd).approve(pool, 0);
```
Ensuring the allowance is reset will prevent tokens from being reused without explicit re-approval, thereby mitigating the risk of unintended token transfers.
