# Unintended Transfer of AMO Liquidity as Rewards

### Summary

The `getReward()` function in SolidlyV2AMO will incorrectly transfer AMO's liquidity reserves as rewards.
This occurs because when the BOOST price is out of range, `_mintSellFarm()` leaves BOOST and USD tokens in the contract without adding them to the liquidity pool.
`getReward()` then mistakenly transfers these tokens along with actual rewards, depleting the AMO's liquidity reserves and potentially destabilizing the BOOST/USD peg.

### Root Cause

In `SolidlyV2AMO.sol`, the `getReward()` function uses `balanceOf()` to determine the amount of tokens to transfer as rewards. However, the `_mintSellFarm()` function in `MasterAMO.sol` doesn't add liquidity when the price is out of range, leaving BOOST and USD tokens in the contract. These tokens can be mistakenly transferred as rewards.

```solidity
        uint256 price = boostPrice();
        if (price > FACTOR - validRangeWidth && price < FACTOR + validRangeWidth) {
            uint256 usdBalance = IERC20Upgradeable(usd).balanceOf(address(this));
            (boostSpent, usdSpent, liquidity) = _addLiquidity(usdBalance, minBoostSpend, minUsdSpend, deadline);
        }
```

[SolidlyV2AMO.sol#L331-L336](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/c65e662999d0c79439703fc6713814b4ad023e01/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV2AMO.sol#L331-L336)
```solidity
        // Calculate the reward amounts and transfer them to the reward vault
        for (uint i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++) {
            if (!whitelistedRewardTokens[tokens[i]]) revert TokenNotWhitelisted(tokens[i]);
            rewardsAmounts[i] = IERC20Upgradeable(tokens[i]).balanceOf(address(this));
            IERC20Upgradeable(tokens[i]).safeTransfer(rewardVault, rewardsAmounts[i]);
        }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The `SolidlyV2AMO` contract needs to have BOOST or USD tokens whitelisted as reward tokens.
2. The price of BOOST needs to be outside the valid range (not between 0.99 and 1.01).
3. The `_mintSellFarm()` function needs to be called, leaving BOOST and USD tokens in the contract.

### External pre-conditions

1. The market conditions need to cause the BOOST price to move outside the valid range.

### Attack Path

1. The market conditions cause the BOOST price to move outside the valid range (< 0.99 or > 1.01).
2. `mintSellFarm()` is called, which internally calls `_mintSellFarm()`.
3. Due to the price being out of range, the liquidity is not added, leaving BOOST and USD tokens in the contract.
4. `getReward()` is called.
5. `getReward()` transfers all BOOST and USD tokens in the contract to the `rewardVault`, including the non-reward tokens from step 3.

### Impact

The protocol suffers unintended loss of BOOST and USD tokens meant for liquidity provision. This could lead to:
1. Depletion of AMO's liquidity reserves.
2. Incorrect reward distribution, potentially overpaying reward recipients.
3. Disruption of the AMO's ability to manage liquidity effectively.
4. Imbalance in the BOOST/USD pool, affecting the peg stability.
