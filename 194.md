# Potential for Protocol Insolvency Due to Stablecoin Depeg

### Summary

If one of the stablecoins paired with the BOOST token (such as USDC or USDT) loses its value (known as "depegging"), the protocol can face a serious risk. This situation allows users, especially arbitrage traders, to exploit the devaluation by swapping depegged stablecoins for BOOST tokens at a discount.

### Root Cause

Insolvency for the protocol when one of the stablecoins is depegged.

So when one stablecoin is paired with boost and that gets depegged than the protocol will lose money.

Consider two pools
1. Boost -USDC pool
2. Boost - USDT pool

Initial pool tokens 

1. 100 Boost - 100 USDC
2. 100 Boost - 100 USDT

Now suppose the USDC depegged by 50%(Stablecoins can be depegged example - https://www.ledgerinsights.com/usdc-depeg-fed-federal-reserve/)

Just after the depeg start, thes pool will be in its initial states but as time passes users/arbitragers will deposit USDC in pool1 take out the Boost and supply the Boost to pool2 and take USDT.

So the amount of USDC is increasing in pool1 and the amount of boost increasing and USDT decreasing in pool2
after the 50% depeg.

pools will be 

1. 70 Boost - 142 USDC
2. 140 Boost - 70 USDT

But the AMO will work continuously and make the USDC - BOOST and USDT - BOOST pegged

And because of this loss will increase continuously and protocol will drain its money.

For pegged to be maintained in pool 1 AMO will use mintAndSellBoost and for pool 2 unfarmBuyBurn.


In the readme, it states that 

> Please list any known issues and explicitly state the acceptable risks for each known issue.
> The acceptable risk is that the paired USD token itself depegs. This will cause a local depeg of BOOST.

But this will not just cause the local depeg but the whole protocol can be drained.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. Stablecoin Depegs
2. Active Arbitrage Traders

### Attack Path

1. Stablecoin Loses Value: USDC or another stablecoin in the pool with BOOST loses its peg.
2. Arbitrage Opportunity: Traders see an opportunity to profit by trading depegged USDC for BOOST in the BOOST-USDC pool, draining BOOST from the protocol.
3. BOOST Transfer to Other Pools: Traders take the BOOST tokens they received and swap them for USDT in the BOOST-USDT pool, reducing USDT and increasing BOOST in that pool.
4. AMO Rebalancing Makes It Worse: The AMO system continuously tries to balance these pools by minting and selling more BOOST to the BOOST-USDC pool and unfarming BOOST from the BOOST-USDT pool, leading to more token loss.
5. Overtime other stablecoins which are pegged will get drained.

### Impact

The impact can be very damaging. The protocol can end up losing almost all its BOOST reserves. This doesn't just cause a temporary "local" depeg of BOOST but could lead to major financial losses for the entire protocol, impacting its users and liquidity providers.

### Mitigation

Use of Oracles for Stablecoin Prices: Use oracles to monitor the prices of stablecoins in real-time. If a stablecoin is detected to be depegged, the protocol can stop AMO operations or freeze affected pools until the issue is resolved.
