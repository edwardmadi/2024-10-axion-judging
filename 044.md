# Use of hardcoded swap path during interactions with SolidlyRouter

### Summary

`_unfarmBuyBurn` and `_mintAndSellBoost` hardcodes the swap path, which in certain cases might not be the optimal route, due to various reasons e.g low pool liquidity.

### Root Cause

In [`_mintAndSellBoost`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/3704f19ea52ebe255861ded3da0d3648c764fb69/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV2AMO.sol#L168-L170), we can see that the route is hardcoded as boost <==> usd, with no way to change it.

```solidity
 function _mintAndSellBoost(
        uint256 boostAmount,
        uint256 minUsdAmountOut,
        uint256 deadline
    ) internal override returns (uint256 boostAmountIn, uint256 usdAmountOut) {
        // Mint the specified amount of BOOST tokens
        IMinter(boostMinter).protocolMint(address(this), boostAmount);

        // Approve the transfer of BOOST tokens to the router
        IERC20Upgradeable(boost).approve(router, boostAmount);

        // Define the route to swap BOOST tokens for USD tokens
>>      ISolidlyRouter.route[] memory routes = new ISolidlyRouter.route[](1);
>>      routes[0] = ISolidlyRouter.route(boost, usd, true);

        if (minUsdAmountOut < toUsdAmount(boostAmount)) minUsdAmountOut = toUsdAmount(boostAmount);

        uint256 usdBalanceBefore = balanceOfToken(usd);
        // Execute the swap and store the amounts of tokens involved
        uint256[] memory amounts = ISolidlyRouter(router).swapExactTokensForTokens(
            boostAmount,
            minUsdAmountOut,
>>          routes,
            address(this),
            deadline
        );
        uint256 usdBalanceAfter = balanceOfToken(usd);
        boostAmountIn = amounts[0];
        usdAmountOut = amounts[1];

        // we check that selling BOOST yields proportionally more USD
        if (usdAmountOut != usdBalanceAfter - usdBalanceBefore)
            revert UsdAmountOutMismatch(usdAmountOut, usdBalanceAfter - usdBalanceBefore);

        if (usdAmountOut < minUsdAmountOut) revert InsufficientOutputAmount(usdAmountOut, minUsdAmountOut);

        emit MintSell(boostAmount, usdAmountOut);
    }
```

The same can also be observed in [`_unfarmBuyBurn`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/3704f19ea52ebe255861ded3da0d3648c764fb69/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV2AMO.sol#L292-L294) where the route is hardcoded to usd <==> boost and cannot be changed.

```solidity
    function _unfarmBuyBurn(
        uint256 liquidity,
        uint256 minBoostRemove,
        uint256 minUsdRemove,
        uint256 minBoostAmountOut,
        uint256 deadline
    )
        internal
        override
        returns (uint256 boostRemoved, uint256 usdRemoved, uint256 usdAmountIn, uint256 boostAmountOut)
    {
//...
        // Define the route to swap USD tokens for BOOST tokens
>>      ISolidlyRouter.route[] memory routes = new ISolidlyRouter.route[](1);
>>      routes[0] = ISolidlyRouter.route(usd, boost, true);

        // Approve the transfer of usd tokens to the router
        IERC20Upgradeable(usd).approve(router, usdRemoved);

        if (minBoostAmountOut < toBoostAmount(usdRemoved)) minBoostAmountOut = toBoostAmount(usdRemoved);

        // Execute the swap and store the amounts of tokens involved
        uint256[] memory amounts = ISolidlyRouter(router).swapExactTokensForTokens(
            usdRemoved,
            minBoostAmountOut,
>>          routes,
            address(this),
            deadline
        );

        // Burn the BOOST tokens received from the liquidity
        // Burn the BOOST tokens received from the swap
        usdAmountIn = amounts[0];
        boostAmountOut = amounts[1];
        IBoostStablecoin(boost).burn(boostRemoved + boostAmountOut);

        emit UnfarmBuyBurn(boostRemoved, usdRemoved, liquidity, boostAmountOut);
    }
```

The hardcoded routes are then used to swap in solidly router through the `swapExactTokensForTokens` function to handle the swaps.

These routes however, at any point in time may not be the most optimal/liquid route meaning that the operations will be forcefully conducted regardless which can lead to unexpected behaviour. 

As an example, majority of usd token's liquidity may be concentrated in WETH/usd pool, so swapping directly through the boost/usd with low liquidity may end up getting only a dust amount of boost.

### External pre-conditions

The boost/usd pool being swapped from might not have enough liquidty
 
### Attack Path

### Impact

Impacts can be two fold. Taking the `_mintAndSellBoost` function, the received tokens from the swap may be very low compared to what would actually be recevied if a more optimal route had been used leading to loss of funds. This is if the slippage parameter set is low enough to actually receive this. The other impact is potential DOS of the function if the needed slippage ends up being higher than the received amount from the swap, causing the function to always fail (at least until the amo bot is recalibrated). Either way, the protocol will be forced to deal with the effects.

### Mitigation

Recommend introducing an admin setter function for the paths to make them configurable.
