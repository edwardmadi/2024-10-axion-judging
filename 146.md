# Loss of precision when calculating time in `MasterUtils` and `AerodromeUtils`

### Summary

Dividing by a week before multiplying will lead to loss of precision

### Root Cause

Dividing by 1 week before multiplying by 1 week 

### Internal pre-conditions

none

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

none

### Impact

This leads loss of precision in the final value 

### PoC

`uint256 unlockTime = ((block.timestamp + lockDuration) / 1 weeks) * 1 weeks;`
`uint256 currentPeriod = (block.timestamp / 1 weeks) * 1 weeks;`
`activePeriod = (block.timestamp / 1 weeks) * 1 weeks;`

looking at the `activePeriod`, `currentPeriod` and `unlockTime` we can observe that this is a similar implementation with the same issue common to them

The issue is Division is being performed before multiplication leading to a loss of precision in the resulting value.

For example;

S = 1728951728 / 604800 * 604800 = 1728518400
A = 1728951728 * 604800 / 604800 = 1728951728

from the calculation we can see that A > S  i.e  A-S = 433328
Therefore S has loss 433328 precision

### Mitigation

This incorrect logic has been implemented in so many parts of the protocol that is [AerodromeUtils:23](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/solidly-utils/contracts/AerodromeUtils.sol#L23), [MasterUtils:71](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/solidly-utils/contracts/MasterUtils.sol#L71), [MasterUtils:81](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/solidly-utils/contracts/MasterUtils.sol#L81) and [MasterUtils:138](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/solidly-utils/contracts/MasterUtils.sol#L81)
