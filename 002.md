# `Minter` Exchanges For Underlying At A Constant Rate

### Summary

The `Minter` exchanges `boostAddress` for `collateralAddress` at a constant rate, which results in vulnerable trades.

### Root Cause

When minting `IBoostStablecoin`, the `Minter` attempts to treat the underlying collateral asset as redeemable for `IBoostStablecoin` at a one-to-one-rate.

For simplicity, let's assume that `boostAddress` and `collateralAddress` both `18` decimals of precision:

```diff
function mint(address to, uint256 amount) external whenNotPaused onlyContract onlyRole(MINTER_ROLE) {
    IERC20Upgradeable(collateralAddress).safeTransferFrom(
        msg.sender,
        treasury,
-       amount / (10 ** (boostDecimals - collateralDecimals))
+       amount
    );
    IBoostStablecoin(boostAddress).mint(to, amount);
    emit TokenMinted(msg.sender, to, amount);
}
```

It is clear that the `Minter` will attempt to mint at a constant rate for the underlying collateral, irrespective of the economic reality.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. The price of collateral is trading at $1.00 and the price of boost is trading at $0.99.

### Attack Path

1. An authorized minter exchanges 100,000 of underlying in exchange for 100,000 boost.

In real terms, the minter has exchanged $100,000 of assets in exchange for $99,000 of boost (1% loss).

### Impact

The `Minter` does not respect the price volatility of the underlying stablecoin, resulting in unfair trades.
