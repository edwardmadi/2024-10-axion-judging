# Lack of Upper Bound Limit in checkIncreaseUnlockTime Function

### Summary

`checkIncreaseUnlockTime` in the Masterutils.sol  function lacks an upper bound limit, potentially allowing tokens to be locked indefinitely, which poses a risk to user access and experience.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

function checkIncreaseUnlockTime(uint256 tokenId, uint256 lockDuration) public view virtual returns (bool) {
    // Retrieve the current locked balance information for the specified tokenId
    Ive.LockedBalance memory currentLocked = Ive(ve).locked(tokenId);
    
    // Calculate the new unlock time by adding the proposed lockDuration to the current block timestamp
    uint256 unlockTime = ((block.timestamp + lockDuration) / 1 weeks) * 1 weeks;

    // Check if the new unlock time exceeds the maximum unlock time limit
    require(unlockTime <= (currentLocked.end + maxUnlockTimeLimit), "Unlock time exceeds maximum limit");

    // Return true if the new unlock time is greater than the current end time of the lock
    return unlockTime > currentLocked.end;
}
