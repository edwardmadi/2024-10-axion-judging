# Incorrect Unlock Time Calculation in checkIncreaseUnlockTime Function

### Summary

The `checkIncreaseUnlockTime` function in the `MasterUtils.sol` inaccurately calculates unlock times when adding a lock duration to the current timestamp. By rounding to the start of the week, the function may omit days when the sum of `block.timestamp + lockDuration` does not reach the next full week. This can lead to an incorrect unlock time, potentially shortening the user's lock period or making it equal to 0 in cases when `lockDuration` is less than 1 week, and creating discrepancies in lock duration management:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/solidly-utils/contracts/MasterUtils.sol#L79-L83

### Root Cause

The current implementation rounds the unlock time to the nearest full week using this formula:

```solidity
        uint256 unlockTime = ((block.timestamp + lockDuration) / 1 weeks) * 1 weeks;
```
This approach ensures that the unlock time is always a multiple of 1 week, but it causes an issue when the `block.timestamp + lockDuration` falls short of the next full week. In such cases, only 1 week is added, even if the intended duration was longer, in the case when `lockDuration` is less than 1 week, we will lose lock duration, and so on.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `block.timestamp + lockDuration` is not an exact multiple of 1 week.
2. `block.timestamp + lockDuration` falls short of the next full week.

### External pre-conditions

The user or operator triggers `checkIncreaseUnlockTime`.

### Attack Path

A user attempting to lock tokens for an extended period may end up with a shorter lock than intended if the lock duration is not a full week. This could affect governance or staking rewards where precise lock times matter.

### Impact

The issue affects the accuracy of the unlock time calculations, potentially leading to shorter lock durations than intended.

### PoC

run this function:

```solidity
     function poc() public returns(uint256 diff) {
        uint256 timestamp = 1728743730; // 2024-10-12 14:35:30 UTC
        uint256 twodays = 259200; // 2 days in seconds
        uint256 timeadj = (timestamp / 1 weeks) * 1 weeks;
        uint256 unlockTime = ((timestamp + twodays) / 1 weeks) * 1 weeks;
        diff = unlockTime - timeadj;
    }
```
or in the terminal run:

```solidity

➜ uint256 timestamp = 1728743730; // 2024-10-12 14:35:30 UTC
➜ uint256 twodays = 259200; // 2 days in seconds
➜ uint256 timeadj = ( timestamp / 1 weeks ) * 1 weeks;
➜ uint256 unlockTime = (( timestamp + twodays ) / 1 weeks ) * 1 weeks;
➜ uint256 diff = unlockTime - timeadj;
➜ diff

├ Hex: 0x0
├ Hex (full word): 0x0
└ Decimal: 0
```

### Mitigation

The unlock time should be calculated without rounding down to the start of the week:

```diff
    function checkIncreaseUnlockTime(uint256 tokenId, uint256 lockDuration) public view virtual returns (bool) {
        Ive.LockedBalance memory currentLocked = Ive(ve).locked(tokenId);
-       uint256 unlockTime = ((block.timestamp + lockDuration) / 1 weeks) * 1 weeks;
+       uint256 unlockTime = (block.timestamp / 1 weeks) * 1 weeks + lockDuration;
        return unlockTime > currentLocked.end;
    }
```
