# `SolidlyV2AMO` is not compatiable with Aerodrome gauges

### Summary

According to additional docs provided by the protocol team, the V2 and V3 implementations of AMO are supposed to be compitable with Velodrome/Aerodrome/Equalizer(V2)/Ramses/Thena, etc:
> We expect the SolidlyV2 tech-implementation work with the “classic” pools on the following Dexes: Velodrome, Aerodrome, Thena, Equalizer (Fantom/Sonic/Base), Ramses and forks (legacy pools), Tokan
However, `getReward` is not compitable with gauge in Aerodrome, causing rewards cannot be withdrawn.

### Root Cause

After adding liquidity to the Boost-USD pool, the protocol will also deposit LP tokens to gauge to farm rewards, and rewards in V2 AMO can be claimed in [`getReward`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV2AMO.sol#L320):
```solidity
    function getReward(
        address[] memory tokens,
        bool passTokens
    ) external override onlyRole(REWARD_COLLECTOR_ROLE) whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
        uint256[] memory rewardsAmounts = new uint256[](tokens.length);
        // Collect the rewards
        if (passTokens) {
            IGauge(gauge).getReward(address(this), tokens);
        } else {
            IGauge(gauge).getReward();
        }
        // Calculate the reward amounts and transfer them to the reward vault
        for (uint i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++) {
            if (!whitelistedRewardTokens[tokens[i]]) revert TokenNotWhitelisted(tokens[i]);
            rewardsAmounts[i] = IERC20Upgradeable(tokens[i]).balanceOf(address(this));
            IERC20Upgradeable(tokens[i]).safeTransfer(rewardVault, rewardsAmounts[i]);
        }
        // Emit an event for collecting rewards
        emit GetReward(tokens, rewardsAmounts);
    }
```

There are two potential ways of getting rewards, `getReward()`, or `getReward(address, address[])`. But from all gauges in Aerodrome, there is no gauge supports such selector, as Aerodrome's [gauge](https://github.com/velodrome-finance/v1/blob/master/contracts/Gauge.sol) takes `getReward(address)` as argument:
```solidity
    /// @inheritdoc IGauge
    function getReward(address _account) external nonReentrant {
        address sender = _msgSender();
        if (sender != _account && sender != voter) revert NotAuthorized();

        _updateRewards(_account);

        uint256 reward = rewards[_account];
        if (reward > 0) {
            rewards[_account] = 0;
            IERC20(rewardToken).safeTransfer(_account, reward);
            emit ClaimRewards(_account, reward);
        }
    }
```

Interestingly, `deposit` works fine, means LP tokens can actually be deposited into the gauge, but no ways of claiming it due to this issue, which in a way increases the impact.

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Rewards accrued in Aerodrome gauges cannot be claimed, causing loss of funds.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add support for `getReward`, maybe consider using enum to identify the type of pool/gauge to interact with.
