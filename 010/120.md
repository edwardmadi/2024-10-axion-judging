# Incorrect `getReward` implementation for certain protocols

### Summary

The `SolidlyV2AMO.sol` contract implements a `getReward` function which calls the gauge to dispense rewards.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV2AMO.sol#L326-L330

The contract has 2 implementation, with and without tokenIds. This was done in an effort to support multiple protocols.

The devs also intend to support velodrome and aerodrome, as mentioned in the docs at https://sticky-yarrow-52e.notion.site/AXION-Audit-Documentation-11bb3e443073802c949bd3700abad968.

The issue is that velodrome and aerodrome gauges implement this function differently.

Velodrome: https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x4d1FFCE9EF3aDBd119d0bDaD5e56706A69f3C0fE#code
Aerodrome: https://basescan.org/address/0xE9DB267dD82e0D67132d71a2F0135B5e93111BE3#code

These contracts implement this function with an `account` field.

```solidity
function getReward(address _account) external nonReentrant
```

While the current AMO contract only has 2 provisions, neither of which fit this.

```solidity
IGauge(gauge).getReward(address(this), tokens);
IGauge(gauge).getReward();
```

So this contract will not work with velodrome/aerodrome contracts, unlike the devs intentions. Thus this is an issue.

### Root Cause

The main cause is that velodrome and aerodrome implement the gauge's `getReward` function differently, leading to incompatibility.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

Incompatibility with Velo and aerodrome pools

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

For Velo and Aerodrome pools, add a third interface options as well
