# `SolidlyV3AMO` tick bounds cannot be changed without loss of yield

### Summary

The `SolidlyV3AMO` implementation allows chancing the lower and upper tick bounds for the underlying Solidly V3 LP pools. However, when this is changed, the previous position existing fees are not retrieved. This results in a loss of yield (fees) through the simple action of changing tick bounds.


### Root Cause

As `SolidlyV3AMO` deposits into a Solidly V3 LP, a concentrated liquidity AMM, each position, defined by the lower-upper tick bounds, generates fees individually.
In order to collect said fees the `burnAndCollect` is called, [as acknowledged by the protocol team](https://sticky-yarrow-52e.notion.site/AXION-Audit-Documentation-11bb3e443073802c949bd3700abad968).

> ClaimFees: the claimFee function/implementation differs across Dexes, but in all/most Dexes fees can be collected with the standardised burnandcollect() function

However, the `burnAndCollect` function is only [called in the `_unfarmBuyBurn` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV3AMO.sol#L235), an action taken when handling the un-farming, buying, and burning of BOOST when it's under the peg.

Because of this design choice, changing the ticks via a [`SolidlyV3AMO::setTickBounds`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV3AMO.sol#L86-L90) call will leave any yield (collected fees) stranded in the previous position.

```solidity
function setTickBounds(int24 tickLower_, int24 tickUpper_) public override onlyRole(SETTER_ROLE) {
    tickLower = tickLower_;
    tickUpper = tickUpper_;
    emit TickBoundsSet(tickLower, tickUpper);
}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

BOOST-USD-pegged-token prices has deviated outside the existing, pre-set `[tickLower, tickUpper]` bounds.

### Attack Path

`SETTER_ROLE` calls `SolidlyV3AMO::setTickBounds`.

### Impact

Any existing yield (fees) on the previous tick position cannot be retrieved without going back to the same tick and waiting to trigger a `unfarmBuyBurn` action (which is done when it's under the peg only). 

Even in that case, then the second position, will not have unclaimed fees and so forth.

Overall, protocol looses the yield maintaining that position.
