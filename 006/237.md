# SolidlyV3AMO is not compatible with Algebra-based DEXes.


### Summary

According to the docs, the Dex scope for SolidlyV3 includes Algebra-based DEXes.

> We expect the SolidlyV3 tech-implementation to work with **Velo** family, **Thena**-Family, as well as more recent “fullyV3” and Algebra-Based Dexes (**Shadow**, **SwapX**, **FenixFinance**)

However, for the Algebra-based DEX implementations (Thena, Fenix, etc.), the current `SolidlyV3AMO` is not compatible.

### Root Cause

From the following code, we can see that the AlgebraPool interface is not compatible with the ones SolidlyV3AMO use. In fact, they have a lot in difference.

SolidlyV3AMO interface for pools: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/interfaces/v3/ISolidlyV3Pool.sol#L7

```solidity
    function mint(
        address recipient,
        int24 tickLower,
        int24 tickUpper,
        uint128 amount,
        uint256 amount0Min,
        uint256 amount1Min,
        uint256 deadline
    ) external returns (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1);

    function burnAndCollect(
        address recipient,
        int24 tickLower,
        int24 tickUpper,
        uint128 amountToBurn,
        uint256 amount0FromBurnMin,
        uint256 amount1FromBurnMin,
        uint128 amount0ToCollect,
        uint128 amount1ToCollect,
        uint256 deadline
    )
        external
        returns (uint256 amount0FromBurn, uint256 amount1FromBurn, uint128 amount0Collected, uint128 amount1Collected);

    function swap(
        address recipient,
        bool zeroForOne,
        int256 amountSpecified,
        uint160 sqrtPriceLimitX96,
        uint256 amountLimit,
        uint256 deadline
    ) external returns (int256 amount0, int256 amount1);
```

AlgebraPool interface:
```solidity
  function mint(
    address leftoversRecipient,
    address recipient,
    int24 bottomTick,
    int24 topTick,
    uint128 liquidityDesired,
    bytes calldata data
  ) external returns (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1, uint128 liquidityActual);

  function burn(int24 bottomTick, int24 topTick, uint128 amount, bytes calldata data) external returns (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1);

  function swap(
    address recipient,
    bool zeroToOne,
    int256 amountRequired,
    uint160 limitSqrtPrice,
    bytes calldata data
  ) external returns (int256 amount0, int256 amount1);

SolidlyV3AMO does not work with AlgebraPool as expected.

### Mitigation

The AlgebraPool interface is similar to SolidlyV3 and UniswapV3, but it is different. In order to support them, it is suggested to add a new AMO for it.
