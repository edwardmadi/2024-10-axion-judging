# `SolidlyV3AMO` is not compatible with Fenix Finance Algebra-Based DEX

### Summary

According to project documentation the `SolidlyV3AMO` contract is intended to work with Fenix Finance DEX pools. However, Fenix Finance pools are not compatible with `ISolidlyV3Pool` pools and implicitly with `SolidlyV3AMO`.

### Root Cause

According to project documentation the `SolidlyV3AMO` contract is intended to work with Fenix Finance DEX pools ([Dex Scope for SolidlyV3 section](https://sticky-yarrow-52e.notion.site/AXION-Audit-Documentation-11bb3e443073802c949bd3700abad968)).

> We expect the SolidlyV3 tech-implementation to work with **Velo** family, **Thena**-Family, as well as more recent “fullyV3” and Algebra-Based Dexes (**Shadow**, **SwapX**, **FenixFinance**)
> - **ClaimFees**: the claimFee function/implementation differs across Dexes, but in all Dexes fees can be collected with the standardised `burnandcollect()` function

However, Fenix Finance pools are not compatible with project `ISolidlyV3Pool` pools.

In the [Deployed Contract Addresses](https://docs.fenixfinance.io/fenix/additional-information/contracts#deployed-contract-addresses) of the Fenix Finance protocol, if we look at the [Pool Deployer contract (0x5aCCAc55f692Ae2F065CEdDF5924C8f6B53cDaa8)](https://docs.fenixfinance.io/fenix/additional-information/contracts#deployed-contract-addresses) we see that it [deploys pools](https://blastscan.io/address/0x5aCCAc55f692Ae2F065CEdDF5924C8f6B53cDaa8#internaltx) of the type [`AlgebraPool.sol`](https://github.com/cryptoalgebra/Algebra/blob/00791ade67bc5b83f6d605a5a6beec01e2fb1095/src/core/contracts/AlgebraPool.sol).


The Fenix Finance DEX Algebra pools are a bit more outdated than the indicated `AlgebraPool` but share the same core functionality, and if we take a deployed example from a Fenix Finance Pool Deployer, [example 0x558c091e64910ba62a58c279a55fefc864251d98](https://blastscan.io/address/0x558c091e64910ba62a58c279a55fefc864251d98#code#F1#L26), it can be observed that several AMO required functions are missing or changed.

AMO V3 requires [`ISolidlyV3Pool` compatible pools](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/interfaces/v3/ISolidlyV3Pool.sol), out of which we see that:

- the `slot0`, `liquidity`, `burnAndCollect` and `quoteSwap` functions/getters are completely missing from the [`AlgebraPool`](https://github.com/cryptoalgebra/Algebra/blob/00791ade67bc5b83f6d605a5a6beec01e2fb1095/src/core/contracts/AlgebraPool.sol).
- [`AlgebraPool::positions`](https://github.com/cryptoalgebra/Algebra/blob/00791ade67bc5b83f6d605a5a6beec01e2fb1095/src/core/contracts/base/Positions.sol#L23) returns a [`Position` structure](https://github.com/cryptoalgebra/Algebra/blob/00791ade67bc5b83f6d605a5a6beec01e2fb1095/src/core/contracts/base/Positions.sol#L14-L20), instead of a [tuple with 3 elements](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/interfaces/v3/ISolidlyV3Pool.sol#L27-L29).
- [`AlgebraPool::mint`](https://github.com/cryptoalgebra/Algebra/blob/00791ade67bc5b83f6d605a5a6beec01e2fb1095/src/core/contracts/AlgebraPool.sol#L55-L63) has a different function signature than [`ISolidlyV3Pool::mint`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/interfaces/v3/ISolidlyV3Pool.sol#L47-L55).
- [`AlgebraPool::swap`](https://github.com/cryptoalgebra/Algebra/blob/00791ade67bc5b83f6d605a5a6beec01e2fb1095/src/core/contracts/AlgebraPool.sol#L243-L249) has a different function signature than [`ISolidlyV3Pool::swap`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/interfaces/v3/ISolidlyV3Pool.sol#L116-L123).


_Note_: As [ShadowDexFi](https://docs.shadowdex.fi/resources/deployed-contract-addresses) and [SwapXfi](https://swapxfi.gitbook.io/swapx-docs) have not launched yet, compatibility with them cannot be verified. However, it is highly likely that both DEXs will be not compatible with the currently existing AMO implementation, as they are also Algebra-Based DEXs.
