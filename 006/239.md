# SolidlyV2AMO is not compatible with Velodrome/Aerodrome.


### Summary

According to the docs, the Dex scope for SolidlyV2 includes Velodrome/Aerodrome.

> We expect the SolidlyV2 tech-implementation work with the “classic” pools on the following Dexes: Velodrome, Aerodrome, Thena, Equalizer (Fantom/Sonic/Base), Ramses and forks (legacy pools), Tokan

However, for Velodrome/Aerodrome implementations, the current `SolidlyV2AMO` is not compatible.

### Root Cause

There are two parts of integration with Velodrome/Aerodrome that are buggy:

1. Gauge
2. Router

Let's go through them one by one (Note, since Velodrome and Aerodrome have basically the same code, I will only post Aerodrome code):

#### 1. Gauge

The main difference is in the `getReward()` function.

Aerodrome interface: https://github.com/aerodrome-finance/contracts/blob/main/contracts/interfaces/IGauge.sol

```solidity
interface IGauge {
    ...
    function getReward(address _account) external;
    ...
}
```

SolidiyV2AMO interface: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/interfaces/v2/IGauge.sol#L4

```solidity
interface IGauge {
    ...
    function getReward(address account, address[] memory tokens) external;

    function getReward(uint256 tokenId) external;

    function getReward() external;
    ...
}
```

#### 2. Router

The main difference is:

1. Aerodrome uses `poolFor` instead of `pairFor` when querying a pool/pair.
2. The `Route` struct is implemented differently, and is used when performing swap

Aerodrome interface: https://github.com/aerodrome-finance/contracts/blob/main/contracts/interfaces/IRouter.sol#L6

```solidity
interface IRouter {
    struct Route {
        address from;
        address to;
        bool stable;
        address factory;
    }

    function poolFor(
        address tokenA,
        address tokenB,
        bool stable,
        address _factory
    ) external view returns (address pool);

    function swapExactTokensForTokens(
        uint256 amountIn,
        uint256 amountOutMin,
        Route[] calldata routes,
        address to,
        uint256 deadline
    ) external returns (uint256[] memory amounts);
    ...
}
```

SolidiyV2AMO interface: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/interfaces/v2/ISolidlyRouter.sol#L4

```solidity
interface ISolidlyRouter {
    struct route {
        address from;
        address to;
        bool stable;
    }

    function pairFor(address tokenA, address tokenB, bool stable) external view returns (address pair);

    function swapExactTokensForTokens(
        uint256 amountIn,
        uint256 amountOutMin,
        route[] memory routes,
        address to,
        uint256 deadline
    ) external returns (uint256[] memory amounts);
    ...
}
```
