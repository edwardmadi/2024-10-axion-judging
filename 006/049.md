# `SolidlyV2AMO` is not compatible with Aerodrome and Velodrome routers due to different pool address creation logic

### Summary

The [initializer](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/d75df3636ea28dd627d548d5d473c5d5477b0dc6/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV2AMO.sol#L81C9-L81C77) in `SolidlyV2AMO` will prevent the usage of both Aerodrome and Velodrom router contracts because they do not use the function signature `ISolidlyRouter(router_).pairFor(usd_, boost_, true);` for creating the pool address.

### Root Cause

The pool address is created in the initializer of the `SolidlyV2AMO` address through a call to the [pairFor](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/d75df3636ea28dd627d548d5d473c5d5477b0dc6/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV2AMO.sol#L81C9-L81C77) function in the corresponding router contract. Documentation states that SolidlyV2 implementation should be compatible with the following Dexes: Velodrome, Aerodrome, Thena, Equalizer (Fantom/Sonic/Base), Ramses and forks (legacy pools), Tokan. Velodrome and Aerodrom both do not use this function signature for creating the pool address there for this initializer will always revert for these two Dexes.

They both use a function named `poolFor` rather to create the pool address. See links to the corresponding functions in their respective repos below.
