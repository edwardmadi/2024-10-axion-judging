# SolidlyV3AMO is not compatible with Velodrome/Aerodrome CLPools


### Summary

According to the docs, the Dex scope for SolidlyV3 includes Velo/Aero family.

> We expect the SolidlyV3 tech-implementation to work with **Velo** family, **Thena**-Family, as well as more recent “fullyV3” and Algebra-Based Dexes (**Shadow**, **SwapX**, **FenixFinance**)

However, for Velo/Aero V3 implementations (mainly their CLPools), the current `SolidlyV3AMO` is not compatible.

### Root Cause

From the following code, we can see that the Velo/Aero CLPool interface is not compatible with the ones SolidlyV3AMO use. In fact, they have a lot in difference.

SolidlyV3AMO interface for pools:
```solidity
    function mint(
        address recipient,
        int24 tickLower,
        int24 tickUpper,
        uint128 amount,
        uint256 amount0Min,
        uint256 amount1Min,
        uint256 deadline
    ) external returns (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1);

    function burnAndCollect(
        address recipient,
        int24 tickLower,
        int24 tickUpper,
        uint128 amountToBurn,
        uint256 amount0FromBurnMin,
        uint256 amount1FromBurnMin,
        uint128 amount0ToCollect,
        uint128 amount1ToCollect,
        uint256 deadline
    )
        external
        returns (uint256 amount0FromBurn, uint256 amount1FromBurn, uint128 amount0Collected, uint128 amount1Collected);

    function swap(
        address recipient,
        bool zeroForOne,
        int256 amountSpecified,
        uint160 sqrtPriceLimitX96,
        uint256 amountLimit,
        uint256 deadline
    ) external returns (int256 amount0, int256 amount1);
```


Velo/Aero CLPool interface:
```solidity
    function mint(address recipient, int24 tickLower, int24 tickUpper, uint128 amount, bytes calldata data)
        external
        returns (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1);

    function burn(int24 tickLower, int24 tickUpper, uint128 amount)
        external
        returns (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1);

    function burn(int24 tickLower, int24 tickUpper, uint128 amount, address owner)
        external
        returns (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1);

    function swap(
        address recipient,
        bool zeroForOne,
        int256 amountSpecified,
        uint160 sqrtPriceLimitX96,
        bytes calldata data
    ) external returns (int256 amount0, int256 amount1);

### Impact

SolidlyV3AMO does not work with Aerodrome/Velodrome V3 CLPools as expected.

### Mitigation

The Velo/Aero CLPool is basically the same as UniswapV3. In order to support them, it is suggested to simply add a UniswapV3-like interface for pools.
