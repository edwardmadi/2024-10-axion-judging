# `_unfarmBuyBurn` function in `SolidlyV3AMO` has wrong preconditions

### Summary

The `_unfarmBuyBurn` function attempts to check that there is more boost in the pool than USD to ensure that the value of BOOST is below peg, but this is incorrect due to how Uniswap V3 works. 

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV3AMO.sol#L321

In `_unfarmBuyBurn` in `SolidlyV3AMO`:

```solidity
        uint256 boostBalance = IERC20Upgradeable(boost).balanceOf(pool);
        uint256 usdBalance = toBoostAmount(IERC20Upgradeable(usd).balanceOf(pool)); // scaled
        if (boostBalance <= usdBalance) revert PriceNotInRange(boostPrice());
```

However, just because the `usdBalance` is higher does not mean that BOOST is not below peg. In fact, someone can just provide a bunch of the stablecoin liquidity at a tick where the value of BOOST is extremely low compared to USD (so price will never get there), but it inflates the balances in the pool. 

Doing this maliciously can prevent anyone from ever calling the public `unfarmBuyBurn` function.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Malicious attacker provides a bunch of USD/stablecoin liquidity (presumably at a tick where price of BOOST is very low)
2. Public `unfarmBuyBurn` function will permanently revert

### Impact

Public `unfarmBuyBurn` function will permanently revert
