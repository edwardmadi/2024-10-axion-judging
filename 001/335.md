# Liquidity Calculation Issue

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV3AMO.sol#L168
This formula assumes that liquidity is linearly related to the amount of USD added relative to the current USD balance in the pool. However, in Uniswap V3 or Solidly V3, the calculation of liquidity is more complex, involving the square root of price ranges (ticks) and the number of tokens.
Accurate liquidity calculation requires considering the price range (tickLower and tickUpper) for providing liquidity as well as the current price (sqrtPriceX96). The current implementation does not take these factors into account.

### Impact

Using such a simplified formula may result in inaccurate liquidity calculations, leading to liquidity provision that does not match expectations, which may cause transaction failures or inefficient use of funds.
Ignoring these key factors can lead to liquidity calculation deviations, affecting the accuracy and effectiveness of transactions.
