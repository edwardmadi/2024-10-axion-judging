# Incorrect Pool Math in `_mintSellFarm` in SolidlyV2  Can Cause AMO Failure

### Summary

In SolidlyV2 on line 345, the function _mintsellfarm computes the amount of BOOST to mint and sell using the formula boostAmountIn = (usdReserve - boostReserve) / 2. This calculation mints and sells more BOOST than required to rebalance the pool. The correct formula should be (usdReserve * boostReserve) ^ (1/2) - boostReserve, which represents the necessary amount of BOOST to maintain the peg without over-minting. 

This incorrect computation can trigger both medium and high severity events, potentially leading to protocol failure.

**Medium Severity**: Selling BOOST below the peg causes relative losses for the protocol.
**High Severity**: If the price falls significantly below the peg, it could cause not only failure to addliquidity, but also liquidity removal through _unfarmBuyBurn, leading to the depletion of protocol-owned liquidity (POL).



### Root Cause

The incorrect formula used in _mintSellFarm (boostAmountIn = (usdReserve - boostReserve) / 2) assumes a simplistic linear rebalancing approach, which does not account for the actual pool math in a constant product (x*y=z) AMM pool. The actual amount of BOOST to be minted and sold should be derived from the square root of the product of reserves, (usdReserve * boostReserve) ^ (1/2) - boostReserve

In SolidlyV2 on line 361, the function _unfarmBuyBurn computes the USD needed to rebalance the pool using the formula usdNeeded = ((boostReserve - usdReserve) / 2). This formula underestimates the amount of USD required to bring the pool back to equilibrium, causing slower re-pegging of the BOOST token. This issue is of medium severity since _unfarmBuyBurn will be called repeatedly until the price is corrected, but it delays rebalancing efficiency.





### Internal pre-conditions

None. Systemic

### External pre-conditions

There is no specific pre-condition for the medium severity issue: _mintsellfarm will consistently mint more BOOST than needed, leading to a loss of AMO profits.

The pre-condition for the high-severity issue is that a large buyer drives the BOOST price above 2 * boostSellRatio, which is the intervention threshold for rebalancing.


### Attack Path

**Numeric Example:**
    - The AMO pool is seeded with 100k BOOST and 100k USDC.
    - A buyer purchases $100k worth of BOOST, leaving the pool with 50k BOOST and 200k USDC.
    - `_mintSellFarm` incorrectly mints and sells 75k BOOST instead of the correct 50k needed to rebalance the pool.
    - This causes the protocol to sell 25k BOOST below the peg price of $1, which results in a medium severity issue.
1. **Medium Severity Impact:**
    - The protocol sells BOOST below its intended peg, causing losses for the protocol as it effectively sells at a discount.
2. **High Severity Impact:**
    - BOOST price drops to $0.83 due to the over-minting and selling.
    - The `_addLiquidity` function reverts because the price falls below the valid range for liquidity addition.
    - The `_unfarmBuyBurn` function may be triggered, which could remove 25k from protocol-owned liquidity (POL) if the price stays below peg.
    - In extreme cases, this could drain the entire POL, causing the protocol to fail as it can no longer support its liquidity pools.

### Impact

While attackers cannot directly profit from these actions, large buyers can destabilize the protocol, potentially causing it to fail by depleting protocol-owned liquidity and driving BOOST price below the peg.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update the formula in _mintSellFarm to properly compute the necessary amount of BOOST to mint and sell using the formula (usdReserve * boostReserve) ^ (1/2) - boostReserve. This ensures that the protocol maintains the correct balance between BOOST and USD in the pool and prevents over-minting, reducing the risk of the protocol selling BOOST below the peg.
