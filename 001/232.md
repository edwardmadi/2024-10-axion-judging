# `unfarmBuyBurn()` does not check for liquidityAmount limit.


### Summary

According to the contest [README](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/tree/main/liquidity-amo#7unfarmbuyburn), when performing `unfarmBuyBurn()`, there should be a check that the removed liquidity should be smaller than a limit. However, this is not implemented in code.

> The function first checks the available liquidity using the position() function and ensures the requested liquidity removal does not exceed the protocol's allowed limits (liquidityAmountLimit).

### Root Cause

According to the contest README, there should be a maximum removed liquidity limit in `unfarmBuyBurn`, but there currently isn't one, in either SolidlyV2AMO or SolidlyV3AMO.

Since `unfarmBuyBurn` may be called by public users if the Boost/USD price is smaller than 1, we don't have much control of the amount of liquidity that may be removed, and the amount of removed liquidity may be more than desired.

```solidity
    function _unfarmBuyBurn(
        uint256 liquidity,
        uint256 minBoostRemove,
        uint256 minUsdRemove,
        uint256 minBoostAmountOut,
        uint256 deadline
    )
        internal
        override
        returns (uint256 boostRemoved, uint256 usdRemoved, uint256 usdAmountIn, uint256 boostAmountOut)
    {
    	// @audit-bug: No removed liquidity amount check.

        // Withdraw the specified amount of liquidity tokens from the gauge
        IGauge(gauge).withdraw(liquidity);

        ...
    }
```
