# `unfarmBuyBurn()` may revert due to swap fees.


### Summary

During `unfarmBuyBurn()` of the AMO contracts, the Boost/USD price is expected to be smaller than 1. The current code has a check that: `swapped out Boost amount >= swapped in USD amount`.

However, this constraint is too strict, and may cause DoS in some cases.

### Root Cause

In most of the cases, the constraint makes sense, since if Boost/USD price is smaller than 1, an amount of Boost would be equivalent to a smaller amount of USD.

However, since we are performing swaps in UniV2/UniV3, we must consider the fees. The constraint may break for some cases.

When fees are enabled. The amount of output Boost is calculated with input USD minus the fees. Example: Boost/USD price is 0.995, fee is 1%, we swap 10000 USD, the amount of Boost we would get is `10000 * (1 - 1%) / 0.995 == 9949.7`, which would actually be lesser than USD. (Note that for simplicity we assume the swap is executed in a simple buy/sell order, and not an AMM swap).

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `unfarmBuyBurn()` is called

### External pre-conditions

1. Fees are enabled for swap.

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

The `unfarmBuyBurn()` function may revert when it shouldn't.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Instead of checking the token amounts, change the check into a boost price check after the swap occurs.
