# Apply slippage protection in the `SolidlyV3AMO::_mintSellFarm()` function

### Summary

As of this moment, the function slippage protection is hardcoded to `1` as seen [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV3AMO.sol#L308-L314):
```javascript
       (, , , , liquidity) = _mintSellFarm(
            boostAmount,
@>            1, // minUsdAmountOut
            1, // minBoostSpend
            1, // minUsdSpend
            block.timestamp + 1 // deadline
        );

```
This can easily be exploited by malicious user, to lower the amount of usd the protocol is going to receive. This can be done with a standard frontrunning opportunity which will go as it follows:
1. Attackes sees the transaction in the mempool and calls `mintSellFarm` or `unfarmBuyBurn` higher gas usage.
2. This will disbalance the token amounts in the pool, negatively impacting the amount that the protocol will receive 



### Root Cause

Root cause of the issue is the slippage parameter, which is hardcoded to `1`

### Internal pre-conditions

Someone call `mintSellFarm` function which slippage protection is hardcoded to `1`

### External pre-conditions

Somebody see the transaction in the mempool and frontruns it to lower the amount of USD which the protocol is going to receive. This is possible on various EVM compatible layer 2s, which the protocol aims to deploy to.

### Attack Path

1. Somebody calls the `mintSellFarm` which calls the `SolidlyV3AMO::_mintSellFarm()`function, which slippage protection is hardcoded to 1
2. Attackes sees the transaction in the mempool and calls `mintSellFarm` or `unfarmBuyBurn` higher gas usage.
3. This will disbalance the token amounts in the pool, negatively impacting the amount that the protocol will receive 

### Impact

The protocol will receive less USD as intended, which then can be deposited as liquidity as seen here:
```javascript
    function _mintSellFarm(
        uint256 boostAmount,
        uint256 minUsdAmountOut,
        uint256 minBoostSpend,
        uint256 minUsdSpend,
        uint256 deadline
    )
        internal
        returns (uint256 boostAmountIn, uint256 usdAmountOut, uint256 boostSpent, uint256 usdSpent, uint256 liquidity)
    {
        (boostAmountIn, usdAmountOut) = _mintAndSellBoost(boostAmount, minUsdAmountOut, deadline);

        uint256 price = boostPrice();
        if (price > FACTOR - validRangeWidth && price < FACTOR + validRangeWidth) {
            uint256 usdBalance = IERC20Upgradeable(usd).balanceOf(address(this));
@>            (boostSpent, usdSpent, liquidity) = _addLiquidity(usdBalance, minBoostSpend, minUsdSpend, deadline);
        }
    }
```
