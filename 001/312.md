# `SolidlyV3AMO.sol::mintSellFarm()` public function can be exploited to Sandwich Attack

### Summary

The public `mintSellFarm()` function is vulnerable to sandwich attack because it lacks proper slippage protection in its internal calling function `_mintSellFarm()`. The function estimates the expected USD output based on the quantity of Boost tokens available, but it assigns a hardcoded value of `1` for `minUsdAmountOut`, which is far too low. This minimal output threshold enables an attacker to exploit the transaction by executing front-running and back-running strategies, allowing them to profit from the price impact triggered by the valid transaction.

### Root Cause

The core issue behind this vulnerability is the setting **hardcoded** `minUsdAmountOut` value of `1` in the input param of `_mintSellFarm` function. This extremely low minimum output fails to provide sufficient protection against price swings triggered by sandwich attacks, exposing the protocol to potential exploitation.

In `SolidlyV2AMO.sol` public function -

```solidity
    function mintSellFarm()
        external
        override
        whenNotPaused
        nonReentrant
        validateSwap(SELL_BOOST)
        returns (uint256 liquidity, uint256 newBoostPrice)
    {
@>        (liquidity, newBoostPrice) = _mintSellFarm(); // Perform the mint and sell, and return liquidity and the new Boost price
        // Checks if the actual average price of boost when selling is greater than the boostLowerPriceSell
        if (newBoostPrice < boostLowerPriceSell) revert PriceNotInRange(newBoostPrice);

        emit PublicMintSellFarmExecuted(liquidity, newBoostPrice);
    }
```

Execution of internal function `_mintSellFarm` -

```solidity
    function _mintSellFarm() internal override returns (uint256 liquidity, uint256 newBoostPrice) {
        uint256 maxBoostAmount = IERC20Upgradeable(boost).balanceOf(pool);
        bool zeroForOne = boost < usd; // Determine the direction of the swap
        // Quote the swap to calculate how much BOOST can be swapped for USD
        (int256 amount0, int256 amount1, , , ) = ISolidlyV3Pool(pool).quoteSwap(
            zeroForOne,
            int256(maxBoostAmount),
            targetSqrtPriceX96
        );
        // Determine the amount of BOOST based on the direction of the swap
        uint256 boostAmount;
        if (zeroForOne) boostAmount = uint256(amount0);
        else boostAmount = uint256(amount1);

        (, , , , liquidity) = _mintSellFarm(
            boostAmount,
 @>         1, // minUsdAmountOut
            1, // minBoostSpend
            1, // minUsdSpend
            block.timestamp + 1 // deadline
        );

        newBoostPrice = boostPrice();
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- A valid user initiates the mintSellFarm() function [as said above in internal pre-condition]
- The attacker front-runs this transaction by selling a large volume of Boost tokens, temporarily lowering the Boost price and inflating the USD price.
- The valid transaction is executed with `minUsdAmountOut` set to `1`, allowing the trade to go through despite the manipulated price.
- The attacker then back-runs the transaction by purchasing Boost tokens at a reduced price, profiting from the manipulated price fluctuations.


### Impact

This sandwich attack enables the attacker to capitalize on price manipulation, resulting in potential losses for both the protocol and its users. The attack could negatively affect the protocolâ€™s token price and cause substantial financial damage if exploited repeatedly.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement slippage protection by setting `minUsdAmountOut` as a percentage of the expected output rather than using a hardcoded value of 1
