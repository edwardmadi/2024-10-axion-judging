# Liquidity is incorrectly calculated during `unfarmBuyBurn()` for SolidlyV2AMO, causing DoS.


### Summary

In SolidlyV2AMO, when performing `unfarmBuyBurn()` and calculating the amount of liquidity to remove, it assumes all the LP tokens are supplied by SolidlyV2AMO. This would result in a overestimated number of liquidity to burn, and may cause DoS or cause the protocol to burn most of it's LP.

### Root Cause

Users can call the public `unfarmBuyBurn()` function to burn liquidity, currently the amount of liquidity to burn is calculated by the following formula: `liquidity = (usdNeeded * totalLp) / usdReserve;`.

However, the main issue here is the `totalLp` means the amount of ALL LP tokens, and not the amount of LP tokens that SolidlyV2AMO owns. It could easily happen that other users are also providing LP for the pool, and the calculated `liquidity` to burn would be too large.

In this case, if the `liquidity` is too large, it would cause an DoS. Or even worse, an attacker can deposit LP, and trick the SolidlyV2AMO to burn nearly all of it's LP tokens, which would be very undesirable.

```solidity
    function _unfarmBuyBurn() internal override returns (uint256 liquidity, uint256 newBoostPrice) {
        (uint256 boostReserve, uint256 usdReserve) = getReserves();

        uint256 usdNeeded = (((boostReserve - usdReserve) / 2) * usdBuyRatio) / FACTOR;

        // @audit-bug: There may be other LP suppliers. Should use the LP tokens that AMO contract owns.

@>      uint256 totalLp = IERC20Upgradeable(pool).totalSupply();
        liquidity = (usdNeeded * totalLp) / usdReserve;

        // Readjust the LP amount and USD needed to balance price before removing LP
        // ( rationale: we first compute the amount of USD needed to rebalance the price in the pool; then first-order adjust for the fact that removing liquidity/totalLP fraction of the pool increases price impact —— less liquidity needs to be removed )
        // liquidity -= liquidity ** 2 / totalLp;

        _unfarmBuyBurn(
            liquidity,
            (liquidity * boostReserve) / totalLp, // the minBoostRemove argument
            toUsdAmount(usdNeeded), // the minUsdRemove argument
            usdNeeded, // the minBoostAmountOut argument
            block.timestamp + 1 // deadline is next block as the computation is valid instantly
        );

        newBoostPrice = boostPrice();
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

N/A

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

Attackers can brick the public `unfarmBuyBurn()` function by depositing LP, or even force the SolidlyV2AMO to burn most of it's liquidity.

### Impact

Attackers can deposit LP to make `unfarmBuyBurn()`. This is an important feature to keep Boost/USD pegged, thus a high severity issue.

This is basically no cost for attackers since the Boost/USD will always go back to 1:1 so no impermanent loss is incurred.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Use the amount of LP tokens that the AMO contract owns instead of totalSupply of LP tokens.
