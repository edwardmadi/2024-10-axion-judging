# Wrong design/ implementation Logic in `_unfarmBuyBurn` Function reverting swaps for a 1:1 ratio

### Summary

In the [_unfarmBuyBurn](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV3AMO.sol#L272-L274) function, the logic for determining whether the swap is successful contains a flawed check that causes the function to revert if the BOOST output is equal to the USD input. 

### Root Cause

In [**SolidlyV3AMO.sol:273-274**](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV3AMO.sol#L272-L274), the reversion condition in the `_unfarmBuyBurn` function is incorrectly written as `<=` instead of `<`. This causes the function to revert even when the `BOOST` output equals the `USD` input, which is unnecessary. The condition should only revert if the `BOOST` output is **less than** the `USD` input to avoid reverting valid 1:1 swaps.



### Internal pre-conditions

1. **AMO Role Needs to Call `_unfarmBuyBurn()`**: The `AMO` role needs to execute the `_unfarmBuyBurn()` function to initiate a liquidity removal operation that includes a swap between `BOOST` and `USD`.

2. **Liquidity in the Pool Must Be Sufficient**: The total liquidity in the `SolidlyV3Pool` must be sufficient to ensure that both `BOOST` and `USD` tokens are available for removal and swapping. This means the pool needs to have a balance that allows for a 1:1 swap to be executed without underflowing the expected output amounts.

3. **The Boost to USD Ratio Must Allow a 1:1 Swap**: The `BOOST` and `USD` tokens' prices must be such that a 1:1 swap ratio is possible, meaning that the `BOOST` output could equal the `USD` input without triggering the reversion condition, allowing for an unexpected state where the transaction fails despite valid input.

### External pre-conditions

1. **Market Conditions Must Allow a 1:1 Swap**: The market conditions for the `BOOST` and `USD` tokens need to allow for a price ratio of exactly 1:1. This means that external factors affecting the token prices must align so that the swap can occur without exceeding or falling below the required thresholds.

2. **Liquidity Pool Must Have a Stable Price**: The `SolidlyV3Pool` must maintain a stable price environment during the execution of the `_unfarmBuyBurn()` function. If external factors cause the price of `BOOST` to suddenly drop or rise significantly just before the swap is executed, it could trigger the reversion condition and prevent the transaction from completing successfully.

### Attack Path

In the `_unfarmBuyBurn` function, the logic for determining whether the swap is successful contains a flawed check that causes the function to revert if the BOOST output is equal to the USD input. This behavior is incorrect because the swap should only revert if the BOOST output is less than the USD input, not when it's equal.

The problematic code snippet is:

```solidity
if (toUsdAmount(boostAmountOut) <= usdAmountIn)
    revert InsufficientOutputAmount({outputAmount: toUsdAmount(boostAmountOut), minRequired: usdAmountIn});
```
Here, the function checks if the USD-equivalent value of the BOOST output (`toUsdAmount(boostAmountOut)`) is less than or equal to the USD input (`usdAmountIn`). If true, it reverts the transaction by throwing an `InsufficientOutputAmount` error. This logic is flawed because even if the swap results in an equal amount of BOOST to USD (i.e., a 1:1 ratio), the swap will revert unnecessarily.

Given that the purpose of the function is to ensure the swap yields at least the input amount's equivalent value, the comparison should strictly be less than (`<`), meaning that the swap should only revert if the BOOST output is lower than the USD input.

### Impact


This issue can cause valid swaps that return a 1:1 ratio to revert incorrectly. As a result, liquidity could be unnecessarily removed or swaps could fail even when they are valid. This could hinder the normal operation of the liquidity management process, impacting liquidity providers and other contract interactions that rely on this function.



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify the reversion condition to only revert when the BOOST output is less than the USD input.
