# slippage vulnerability

### Summary

The lack of slippage protection in `_unfarmBuyBurn` will cause a potential significant loss of tokens for the protocol and its users as an attacker will exploit price fluctuations by frontrunning the swap transaction.

### Root Cause

 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV2AMO.sol#L252-L316


In SolidlyV2AMO.sol:252, there is no slippage protection on the swap action, allowing an attacker to manipulate the price just before the transaction is executed. This creates a vulnerability where the protocol could receive far fewer tokens than expected.

In SolidlyV2AMO.sol:301, the swapExactTokensForTokens function is executed without a predefined slippage limit.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The protocol needs to call swapExactTokensForTokens to swap tokens without a slippage check.
2. The _unfarmBuyBurn function needs to process swaps based on the market price at the time of transaction mining.
3. The protocol needs to be handling liquidity removal with a fluctuating token price, enabling an attacker to predict the swap.

### External pre-conditions

1. Token prices need to be volatile in the liquidity pool.
2. The attacker needs to manipulate the pool price by submitting a large transaction to affect the token price.
3. The router contract must allow execution of swaps based on the current market price without a safeguard for slippage.

### Attack Path

1. The attacker monitors when `unfarmBuyBurn` is called, preparing a front-run transaction.
2. The attacker manipulates the liquidity pool by submitting a large transaction, causing a significant price change just before the protocolâ€™s swap occurs.
3. The attacker submits their transaction, adjusting the market price so that the protocol receives far fewer tokens than expected.
4. The protocol completes the swap but receives fewer tokens due to price manipulation.

### Impact

The protocol suffers an approximate loss of the difference between expected and actual tokens received during the swap. The attacker gains a significant advantage by obtaining an unfair share of the manipulated tokens.

The protocol may suffer a 5%-10% loss in liquidity during a swap. The attacker gains this liquidity advantage by profiting from the price difference.
Users may also experience reduced token returns due to the slippage vulnerability.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To mitigate this issue, implement slippage protection by setting a minimum acceptable amount of tokens to receive from the swap, preventing swaps with unfavorable price fluctuations from proceeding. Add a configurable slippage tolerance parameter to the swapExactTokensForTokens function to ensure that the swap only occurs within a safe price range.
