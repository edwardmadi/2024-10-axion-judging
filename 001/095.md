# _unfarmBuyBurn may remove less boost than usd.

### Summary

In the function `SolidlyV2AMO.sol#_unfarmBuyBurn`, some liquidity will be removed in order to increase the price of boost. So that, when remove the liquidit, the removed boost should be more than usd. As the comments say:

```solidity
// Ensure the BOOST amount is greater than or equal to the USD amount
```

However, as validRemovingRatio is larger than 1. When `boostRemoved * validRemovingRatio >= usdRemoved` , boostRemoved may be less than usdRemoved, which leads to the price increasing. For example, when boostRemoved = 1000e18, usdRemoved = 1100e6, and validRemovingRatio = 1.1, boostRemoved \* validRemovingRatio >= usdRemoved. However, this operation cause the price of boost decreasing.

```solidity
        if ((boostRemoved * validRemovingRatio) / FACTOR < toBoostAmount(usdRemoved))
            revert InvalidRatioToRemoveLiquidity();
```
