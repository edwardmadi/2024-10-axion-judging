# Malicious actors can cause potential losses for the protocol by manipulating transaction timing and slippage

### Summary

The lack of slippage protection and the use of `block.timestamp` for swap deadlines in the `_mintSellFarm` and `_unfarmBuyBurn` functions will cause potential losses for the protocol as malicious actors can manipulate transaction timing and exploit slippage parameters, leading to unfavorable execution of transactions.

### Root Cause

In `SolidlyV2AMO.sol`, the functions `_mintSellFarm` (lines [347-353](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV2AMO.sol#L347-L353)) and `_unfarmBuyBurn` (lines [374](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV2AMO.sol#L374)) and `SolidlyV3AMO.sol` (lines [308-314](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV3AMO.sol#L308-L314) and [328-334](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV3AMO.sol#L328-L334)):

- **Missing Slippage Control**: The functions use hardcoded minimal values (e.g., `1`) for slippage parameters such as `minUsdAmountOut`, `minBoostSpend`, `minUsdSpend`, and `minBoostAmountOut`, without proper validation. This lack of slippage control allows transactions to proceed regardless of unfavorable execution conditions.

- **Using `block.timestamp` for Deadlines**: The functions set the `deadline` parameter to `block.timestamp + 1`, which does not enforce immediate execution. Validators can manipulate the transaction timing and include it in a block when conditions are unfavorable for the protocol.

```solidity
...

        (, , , , liquidity) = _mintSellFarm(
            boostAmountIn,
            toUsdAmount(boostAmountIn), // minUsdAmountOut
            1, // minBoostSpend
            1, // minUsdSpend
            block.timestamp + 1 // deadline
        );
        
...

        // Execute the swap and store the amounts of tokens involved
        uint256[] memory amounts = ISolidlyRouter(router).swapExactTokensForTokens(
            boostAmount,
            minUsdAmountOut,
            routes,
            address(this),
            deadline
        );
      
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. A malicious validator or attacker monitors the protocol's transactions in the mempool and is capable of:

   - Withholding transactions to manipulate timing.
   - Front-running and back-running transactions to perform sandwich attacks.

2. Market conditions permit noticeable price impact from the protocol's trades, making manipulation profitable.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The protocol suffers potential financial losses due to executing transactions under unfavorable conditions, such as increased slippage or adverse price movements. The malicious validator may exploit this situation to extract Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) for personal gain, negatively affecting the protocol's stability and financial health.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The protocol should implement slippage controls and specify an appropriate deadline parameter based on off-chain timing considerations.
