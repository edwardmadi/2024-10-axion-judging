# H: The function _unfarmBuyBurn() will not work when the AMO has low liquidity in the pool.

### Summary

In the pool there is more `BoostAmount` than the `UsdAmount`. So the `boostPrice()` is less than `FACTOR - validRangeWidth`.
And then the AMO is trying to unfarm and buyburn but the amount `liquidity = (usdNeeded * totalLp) / usdReserve;` is bigger than `liquidity of AMO`.
Also AMO can't do addLiquidity because the `boostPrice()` is less than `FACTOR - validRangeWidth`.
So the AMO can't do unfarmBuyBurn, and then this contract will not work any longer.

### Root Cause

In `SolidlyV2AMO.sol:358` the _unfarmBuyBurn() function.
`liquidity = (usdNeeded * totalLp) / usdReserve;`

### Internal pre-conditions

1. AMO deposits the 10000 BOOST and 10000 USD in the pool first.
2. Bob deposits the 20000 BOOST and 20000 USD in the pool.

### External pre-conditions

As the many swaps in the pool, the result is the Amount of Boost is more than the amount in usd terms.
So the amount of Boos and usd become 40000 and 20000 (this is only suggestion, not the real).

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

1. The AMO can't to do addLiquidity and removeLiquidity so the AMO can't control the price of the boost in the pool.

### PoC

Please sure the decimal of BOOST is 18 and the decimal of USD is 6. And this is based on the UniswapV2.
First the liquidity of the AMO is `sqrt(10000*10**18 * 10000*10**6)-10**3 = 10**16 - 1000`  and the totalSupply is 10**16.
And then the Bob deposited and the liquidity of the Bob is `min(amount0.mul(_totalSupply) / _reserve0, amount1.mul(_totalSupply) / _reserve1) = min(20000*10**18 * 10**16) / 10000*10**18, 20000**10**6*10**16/10000*10**18) = 2*10**16`
And then many swaps occurs the amounts of boost and usd became 40000 and 20000.
`uint256 usdNeeded = (((boostReserve - usdReserve) / 2) * usdBuyRatio) / FACTOR  ~=  10000 * 10**18`
`liquidity = (usdNeeded * totalLp) / usdReserve = (10000*10**18*3*10**16)/(20000*10**18) = 1.5*10**16`;
The need liquidity is bigger than the liquidity of the AMO.


### Mitigation

I think AMO can do addLiquidity when the boostPrice() is in the right value between 'FACTOR - validRangeWidth  and FACTOR + validRangeWidth' So the AMO add the liquidity with amounts of boost and usd in the pool and control the boostPrice.
```diff
    function _unfarmBuyBurn() internal override returns (uint256 liquidity, uint256 newBoostPrice) {
        (uint256 boostReserve, uint256 usdReserve) = getReserves();

        uint256 usdNeeded = (((boostReserve - usdReserve) / 2) * usdBuyRatio) / FACTOR;
        uint256 totalLp = IERC20Upgradeable(pool).totalSupply();
        liquidity = (usdNeeded * totalLp) / usdReserve;
+        if(liquidity > IERC20Upgradeable(pool).balanceof(address(this))) _addLiquidity(usdAmount, minBoostSpend, minUsdSpend, deadline);
```
```diff
    function _addLiquidity(
        uint256 usdAmount,
        uint256 minBoostSpend,
        uint256 minUsdSpend,
        uint256 deadline
    ) internal override returns (uint256 boostSpent, uint256 usdSpent, uint256 liquidity) {
        // We only add liquidity when price is withing range (close to $1)
        // Price needs to be in range: 1 +- validRangeRatio / 1e6 == factor +- validRangeRatio
        // if price is too high, we need to mint and sell more before we add liqudiity
        uint256 price = boostPrice();
-        if (price <= FACTOR - validRangeWidth || price >= FACTOR + validRangeWidth) revert InvalidRatioToAddLiquidity();
+        if (price >= FACTOR + validRangeWidth) revert InvalidRatioToAddLiquidity();
```
