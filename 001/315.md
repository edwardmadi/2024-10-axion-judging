# SolidlyV3 pool token balance proportion does not correspond to the price and is easy to manipulate

### Summary

Liquidity in `_unfarmBuyBurn()` and `_addLiquidity()` is calcalated using `balanceOf(pool)`, but SolidlyV3 pool token balance proportion does not correspond to the price and is easy to manipulate. Pool balances can be easily manipulated using flashloans and swaps, which can be exploited by attackers. Also pool contract holds accumulated fees on its balances, which affects the calculation of liquidity, although it should not.

### Root Cause

```solidity
uint256 totalLiquidity = ISolidlyV3Pool(pool).liquidity();
uint256 boostBalance = IERC20Upgradeable(boost).balanceOf(pool);    <<<
uint256 usdBalance = toBoostAmount(IERC20Upgradeable(usd).balanceOf(pool));    <<<
if (boostBalance <= usdBalance) revert PriceNotInRange(boostPrice());

liquidity = (totalLiquidity * (boostBalance - usdBalance)) / (boostBalance + usdBalance);
liquidity = (liquidity * LIQUIDITY_COEFF) / FACTOR;
```


### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

Presence of a malicious user (although this is not always necessary, because the calculation of liquidity is also affected by fees on the balance of the pool).

### Attack Path

Attacker manipulates pool balances using flashloans and swaps, causing the function `balanceOf(pool)` to return values ​​at which the user experiences losses.

### Impact

Farming/unfarming of Boost on unfavorable conditions for the user.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Do not rely on `balanceOf(pool)` function while calculating liquidity.
