# Incorrect calculation will prevent correct repeg

### Summary

`_mintSellFarm` and `_unfarmBuyBurn` in SolidlyV2AMO are used to stabilize the price between BOOST and USD token. Due to wrong calculation, after calling this function, price will not be moved into desired range.


### Root Cause

Let's follow the logic of `boostAmountIn` calculation inside `_mintSellFarm` function.

1. Let's assume that the pool is initialized with 1000 Boost and 1000 USD.

`k = 1000 * 1000 = 1000000`

2. Someone creates a swap to receive 100 Boost. After swap:

900 Boost ; 1111,11 USD ; k = 900 * 1111,11 = 1000000

3. To bring the price back to desired range between 0.99 and 1.01, `mintSellFarm` is called. `boostAmountIn` calculation in `_mintSellFarm` in SolidlyV2AMO:

boostAmountIn = ((1111,11 - 900) / 2) * 80000 / 100000 = 84,4

This is the amount of boost that will be swapped for USD.

Now lets calulate the k and reserves after swap.

1000000 / 984,4 = 1015,85

984,4 Boost ; 1015,85 USD ; k = 984,4 * 1015,85 = 1000000

Now let's calculate Boost price in term of USD.

984,4 / 1015,85 = 0,969

The price is outside of the 0.99 - 1.01 range which means that repeg was not successful.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

Repegging mechanism in SolidlyV2AMO does not work correctly due to wrong calculation. After swaps the price will not be in desired 0.99 - 1.01 price range. Function does not work as intended and after calling it, the price between tokens is not stable which is the protocol design.

### PoC

Steps and calculations described in root cause.

### Mitigation

Fix the calculation in these functions. They should bring the price back to desired range.
