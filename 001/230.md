# `validRemovingRatio` check in `unfarmBuyBurn()` is incorrect.


### Summary

When users perform `unfarmBuyBurn()` check, the `validRemovingRatio` check exists to make sure the Boost/USD price is always smaller than 1. However, this check is incorrectly implemented.

### Root Cause

First, from the check in `setParams`, we can know that the `validRemovingRatio` must always be >= `FACTOR`.

What the `unfarmBuyBurn()` function does is that when Boost/USD price is smaller than 1, we try to remove some liquidity, and use the acquired USD to buy back Boost tokens to increase the Boost/USD price. When removing liquidity, `boostRemoved` and `usdRemoved` is the amount of tokens removed. However, the following check is incorrect. 

```solidity
      // Ensure the BOOST amount is greater than or equal to the USD amount
      if ((boostRemoved * validRemovingRatio) / FACTOR < toBoostAmount(usdRemoved))
          revert InvalidRatioToRemoveLiquidity();
```

According to the comments, the check is makes sure the BOOST amount is greater than or equal to USD amount, since Boost/USD price is smaller than 1, which makes sense. But the check is actually enforcing `BoostPrice = usdRemoved / boostRemoved <= validRemovingRatio`. This means if `validRemovingRatio` is set to a number > `FACTOR`, the `unfarmBuyBurn` function can be called when the BoostPrice > 1, which is undesirable.

An example, say `validRemovingRatio` is set to 1.2e6 (note that `FACTOR` is 1e6), and the current Boost/USD price is 1.1, and when removing liquidity, we acquire `boostRemoved == 10000`, `usdRemoved == 11000`. We can see that the original check still passes because `(boostRemoved * validRemovingRatio) / FACTOR < toBoostAmount(usdRemoved)` is equivalent to `10000 * 1.2 < 11000` which is false, and the code will not revert even though the Boost/USD price is above 1.

The same issue occurs for SolidlyV2AMO and SolidlyV3AMO.

```solidity
    function setParams(
        uint256 boostMultiplier_,
        uint24 validRangeWidth_,
        uint24 validRemovingRatio_,
        uint256 boostLowerPriceSell_,
        uint256 boostUpperPriceBuy_,
        uint256 boostSellRatio_,
        uint256 usdBuyRatio_
    ) public override onlyRole(SETTER_ROLE) {
@>      if (validRangeWidth_ > FACTOR || validRemovingRatio_ < FACTOR) revert InvalidRatioValue();
        ...
    }

    function _unfarmBuyBurn(
        uint256 liquidity,
        uint256 minBoostRemove,
        uint256 minUsdRemove,
        uint256 minBoostAmountOut,
        uint256 deadline
    )
        internal
        override
        returns (uint256 boostRemoved, uint256 usdRemoved, uint256 usdAmountIn, uint256 boostAmountOut)
    {
        ...
        // Remove liquidity and store the amounts of USD and BOOST tokens received
        (boostRemoved, usdRemoved) = ISolidlyRouter(router).removeLiquidity(
            boost,
            usd,
            true,
            liquidity,
            minBoostRemove,
            minUsdRemove,
            address(this),
            deadline
        );
        uint256 usdBalanceAfter = balanceOfToken(usd);

        // Ensure the BOOST amount is greater than or equal to the USD amount
@>      if ((boostRemoved * validRemovingRatio) / FACTOR < toBoostAmount(usdRemoved))
@>          revert InvalidRatioToRemoveLiquidity();

        ...
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `unfarmBuyBurn()` is called
2. `validRemovingRatio` is set to any value larget than `FACTOR`

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

The `unfarmBuyBurn()` function may execute even when the Boost/USD price is larger than 1.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Change to correct formula:

```solidity
      if ((boostRemoved * FACTOR) / validRemovingRatio < toBoostAmount(usdRemoved))
          revert InvalidRatioToRemoveLiquidity();
```
