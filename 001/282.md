# Liquidity is incorrectly calculated during `unfarmBuyBurn()` for SolidlyV3AMO, causing DoS.


### Summary

SolidlyV3 has the same liquidity calculation as UniswapV3. Currently, when performing `unfarmBuyBurn()` and calculating the amount of liquidity to remove, instead of using the liquidity that is added by SolidlyV3AMO, it uses the entire active liquidity in Pool, which can be very overestimated.

### Root Cause

Users can call the public `unfarmBuyBurn()` function to burn liquidity, currently the amount of liquidity to burn is calculated by the following formula: `liquidity = (totalLiquidity * (boostBalance - usdBalance)) / (boostBalance + usdBalance);`.

However, the main issue here is the `totalLiquidity` means the amount of active liquidity within the SolidlyV3 pool, and not the amount of liquidity that SolidlyV3AMO owns. It could easily happen that other users are also providing LP for the pool, and the calculated `liquidity` to burn would be too large.

In this case, if the `liquidity` is too large, it would cause an DoS. Or even worse, an attacker can deposit LP, and trick the SolidlyV3AMO to burn nearly all of it's LP tokens, which would be very undesirable.

```solidity
    function _unfarmBuyBurn(
        uint256 liquidity,
        uint256 minBoostRemove,
        uint256 minUsdRemove,
        uint256 minBoostAmountOut,
        uint256 deadline
    )
        internal
        override
        returns (uint256 boostRemoved, uint256 usdRemoved, uint256 usdAmountIn, uint256 boostAmountOut)
    {
        (uint256 amount0Min, uint256 amount1Min) = sortAmounts(minBoostRemove, minUsdRemove);
        // Remove liquidity and store the amounts of USD and BOOST tokens received
        (
            uint256 amount0FromBurn,
            uint256 amount1FromBurn,
            uint128 amount0Collected,
            uint128 amount1Collected
        ) = ISolidlyV3Pool(pool).burnAndCollect(
                address(this),
                tickLower,
                tickUpper,
                uint128(liquidity),
                amount0Min,
                amount1Min,
                type(uint128).max,
                type(uint128).max,
                deadline
            );
        ...
    }

    function _unfarmBuyBurn() internal override returns (uint256 liquidity, uint256 newBoostPrice) {
        // @audit-bug: This is total liquidity, not liquidity that SolidlyV3AMO owns.
@>      uint256 totalLiquidity = ISolidlyV3Pool(pool).liquidity();
        uint256 boostBalance = IERC20Upgradeable(boost).balanceOf(pool);
        uint256 usdBalance = toBoostAmount(IERC20Upgradeable(usd).balanceOf(pool)); // scaled
        if (boostBalance <= usdBalance) revert PriceNotInRange(boostPrice());

@>      liquidity = (totalLiquidity * (boostBalance - usdBalance)) / (boostBalance + usdBalance);
        liquidity = (liquidity * LIQUIDITY_COEFF) / FACTOR;

        _unfarmBuyBurn(
            liquidity,
            1, // minBoostRemove
            1, // minUsdRemove
            1, // minBoostAmountOut
            block.timestamp + 1 // deadline
        );

        newBoostPrice = boostPrice();
    }

### Internal pre-conditions

N/A

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

Attackers can brick the public `unfarmBuyBurn()` function by depositing LP, or even force the SolidlyV3AMO to burn most of it's liquidity.

### Impact

Attackers can deposit LP to make `unfarmBuyBurn()`. This is an important feature to keep Boost/USD pegged, thus a high severity issue.

This is basically no cost for attackers since the Boost/USD will always go back to 1:1 so no impermanent loss is incurred.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

1. Only use the amount of liquidity that SolidlyV3AMO owns.
2. Calculate the corresponding tokenUSD/tokenBoost that SolidlyV3AMO has in Pool, and figure out an amount of USD tokens to retrieve for swap.
3. Use the answer from step 2 to calculate the amount of liquidity to burn.

It is suggested to use liquidity math from UniswapV3 library instead of self-implementing: https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/main/contracts/libraries/LiquidityAmounts.sol
