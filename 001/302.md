# Amount of `boostAmountIn` used for swapping to USD is calculated incorrectly.


### Summary

Amount of `boostAmountIn` used for swapping to USD is calculated incorrectly.

### Root Cause

The formula is `boostAmountIn = (((usdReserve - boostReserve) / 2) * boostSellRatio) / FACTOR;`. However, this formula is incorrect and error increases as the Boost/USD price increases.

First, let's assume `boostSellRatio == FACTOR`, and the pool use a constant-K AMM. Let's see two cases:

Case 1: boostReserve = 1e18, usdReserve = 1.2e18. boostAmountIn = (1.2e18 - 1e18) / 2 = 0.1e18. After swap, boostReserve = 1.1e18, usdReserve = 1e18 * 1.2e18 / 1.1e18 = 1.09e18. Price of Boost/USD becomes 1.09/1.1 = 0.99.

Case 2: boostReserve = 1e18, usdReserve = 10e18. boostAmountIn = (10e18 - 1e18) / 2 = 4.5e18. After swap, boostReserve = 5.5e18, usdReserve = 1e18 * 10e18 / 5.5e18 = 1.82e18. Price of Boost/USD becomes 1.82/5.5 = 0.33.

It is true that we can adjust the `boostSellRatio` to swap a smaller amount, but considering there is not a single value `boostSellRatio` that can fit for all prices, it may very well happen for some cases, the price will fall too much, and for some cases, the price doesn't move at all.

Actually, since we know how SolidlyV2 handles AMM curve for stableswaps, we can directly calculate the amount of boost tokens needed to make Boost/USD peg again. There is no need to use such a heuristic calculation.

```solidity
    function _mintSellFarm() internal override returns (uint256 liquidity, uint256 newBoostPrice) {
        (uint256 boostReserve, uint256 usdReserve) = getReserves();

@>      uint256 boostAmountIn = (((usdReserve - boostReserve) / 2) * boostSellRatio) / FACTOR;

        (, , , , liquidity) = _mintSellFarm(
            boostAmountIn,
            toUsdAmount(boostAmountIn), // minUsdAmountOut
            1, // minBoostSpend
            1, // minUsdSpend
            block.timestamp + 1 // deadline
        );

        newBoostPrice = boostPrice();
    }
```

Also note that for the public `mintSellFarm()` function, if the price moves too much below 1, the transaction would fail, thus it is important to set a correct `boostSellRatio` for the current implementation.

```solidity
    function mintSellFarm()
        external
        override
        whenNotPaused
        nonReentrant
        validateSwap(SELL_BOOST)
        returns (uint256 liquidity, uint256 newBoostPrice)
    {
        (liquidity, newBoostPrice) = _mintSellFarm(); // Perform the mint and sell, and return liquidity and the new Boost price
        // Checks if the actual average price of boost when selling is greater than the boostLowerPriceSell
@>      if (newBoostPrice < boostLowerPriceSell) revert PriceNotInRange(newBoostPrice);

        emit PublicMintSellFarmExecuted(liquidity, newBoostPrice);
    }
```

### Impact

Either the price may move too little, or the price may move too large (and may DoS) when `mintSellFarm()` is called.

### Mitigation

Directly calculate the amount of boost tokens required to make Boost/USD peg to 1:1.
