# Insufficient Output Amount Error in SolidlyV3AMO Contract

### Summary

The `SolidlyV3AMO` contract encounters an error during the `_mintAndSellBoost` function execution, where the output amount of USD received after a swap is consistently deemed insufficient. This issue arises from the comparison between the converted output amount and the expected input amount, which leads to a perpetual revert condition. The calculation of `minUsdAmountOut` does not account for transaction fees accurately, inflating the expectations of the output amount.


### Root Cause

The primary cause of the issue is the conditional statement:

```solidity
if (toBoostAmount(usdAmountOut) <= boostAmountIn)
    revert InsufficientOutputAmount({outputAmount: toBoostAmount(usdAmountOut), minRequired: boostAmountIn});
```

In this statement, `usdAmountOut`, which is derived after executing the swap, is consistently lower than `boostAmountIn` due to the deductions from fees applied during the swap. Consequently, the function always reverts, rendering it ineffective. For reference, see the relevant line of code [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV3AMO.sol#L159).

The `toBoostAmount` function converts the received `usdAmountOut` to a `boostAmount` using the formula:

```solidity
function toBoostAmount(uint256 usdAmount) internal view returns (uint256) {
    return usdAmount * 10 ** (boostDecimals - usdDecimals);
}
```

Given that:
- `boostDecimals = 18`
- `usdDecimals = 6`

This conversion results in a significant difference between the expected boost amount and the actual USD output, further compounding the issue.

### Internal pre-conditions

- The contract must have sufficient BOOST tokens minted.
- The pool should be correctly configured to handle swaps.


### External pre-conditions

- The Solidly V3 Pool must be operational and accessible.
- The swap mechanism must support the expected trading pairs (BOOST and USD).


### Attack Path


1. **Minting BOOST**: The contract mints the specified amount of BOOST tokens.
2. **Approval for Swap**: The contract approves the transfer of minted BOOST tokens to the pool.
3. **Executing the Swap**: The swap is executed, but the expected output is decreased due to fees.
4. **Output Verification**: The conditional check fails, causing the function to revert.
5. **Reverting**: The function does not complete successfully, leading to an inability to sell BOOST for USD.


### Impact


Due to the faulty output condition, users will experience continuous transaction failures when attempting to perform swaps. This can result in a negative user experience and potential loss of trust in the `SolidlyV3AMO` contract.


### PoC

To demonstrate the issue, consider the following scenario:

1. **Inputs**:
   - `boostAmount`: 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 (1 BOOST token)
   - `minUsdAmountOut`: 100 (expected USD after swap)
   - **Assumed Fees**: 10% (leading to an output of 90 USD after swap)

2. **Execution**:
   - After executing the swap, the `usdAmountOut` is 90 USD.
   - The conversion using `toBoostAmount(90)` yields 900,000,000,000,000,000 (0.9 BOOST).
   - The condition `if (0.9 <= 1)` evaluates to true, triggering the revert.


### Mitigation

To mitigate this issue, the following adjustments are recommended:

1. **Adjust the Condition**: Modify the condition to account for the fees by introducing a threshold for acceptable fees or adjusting the expected output based on historical data.

2. **Accurate Fee Calculation**: Implement a more precise calculation method for `minUsdAmountOut` that factors in the fees expected during the swap.

3. **Error Handling**: Provide a mechanism to report the actual USD amount received and give insights into why a revert may occur, rather than simply reverting the transaction.
