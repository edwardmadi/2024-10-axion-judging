# Rounding Down Liquidity Calculation Leads to Insufficient USD Withdrawal in Liquidity Pool

### Summary

In scenarios where liquidity is calculated as liquidity = (usdNeeded * totalLp) / usdReserve, the calculation of liquidity rounds down to the nearest integer due to Solidity’s inherent behavior when dealing with integers. This rounding can cause the corresponding USD that will be withdrawn (derived as (liquidity * usdReserve) / totalLp) to be lower than the original usdNeeded. As a result, the condition usdNeeded > (liquidity * usdReserve) / totalLp can be true, leading to insufficient USD being withdrawn during liquidity removal operations, potentially causing the function to fail.

### Root Cause

at L372 the ```minUsdRemove``` argument uses ```toUsdAmount(usdNeeded)```, however, only ```toUsdAmount((liquidity * usdReserve) / totalLp``` will be withdrawn. In the case that ``` toUsdAmount(usdNeeded) > toUsdAmount((liquidity * usdReserve) / totalLp```, the slippage control will fail the transaction.

### Internal pre-conditions

```usdNeeded > toUsdAmount((liquidity * usdReserve) / totalLp```

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

Here is an example: 

Total Liquidity (totalLp) = 1,000,001 LP tokens
USD Reserves (usdReserve) = 399,999 * 10^18 USD
BOOST Reserves (boostReserve) = 499,999 * 10^18 BOOST
usdNeeded = 40,000 * 10^18 USD (calculated from step 1): uint256 usdNeeded = (((boostReserve - usdReserve) / 2) * usdBuyRatio) / FACTOR; //

We have ```usdNeeded >  (liquidity * usdReserve) / totalLp``` = 39,999 * 10^18


Therefore, the function will fail unnecessarily since only 39,999 * 10^18 is returned but the ```minUsdRemove``` uses ```usdNeeded```, which is  40,000 * 10^18 USD .


### Impact


The minUsdRemove used ```toUsdAmount(usdNeeded```  instead of ```toUsdAmount((liquidity * usdReserve) / totalLp)```

This discrepancy can cause the transaction to revert, even though the underlying intent of withdrawing liquidity and USD is valid, impacting the success of liquidity removal operations.

### Mitigation




```diff
 function _unfarmBuyBurn() internal override returns (uint256 liquidity, uint256 newBoostPrice) {
        (uint256 boostReserve, uint256 usdReserve) = getReserves();

        uint256 usdNeeded = (((boostReserve - usdReserve) / 2) * usdBuyRatio) / FACTOR; // usdNeeded is not a good name here
        uint256 totalLp = IERC20(pool).totalSupply();
        liquidity = (usdNeeded * totalLp) / usdReserve;

        // Readjust the LP amount and USD needed to balance price before removing LP
        // ( rationale: we first compute the amount of USD needed to rebalance the price in the pool; then first-order adjust for the fact that removing liquidity/totalLP fraction of the pool increases price impact —— less liquidity needs to be removed )
        // liquidity -= liquidity ** 2 / totalLp;

        _unfarmBuyBurn(
            liquidity, // Withdraw the specified amount of liquidity tokens from the gauge
            (liquidity * boostReserve) / totalLp, // the minBoostRemove argument
-            toUsdAmount(usdNeeded), 
+          toUsdAmount((liquidity * usdReserve) / totalLp),
            usdNeeded, // the minBoostAmountOut argument
            block.timestamp + 1 // deadline is next block as the computation is valid instantly
        );

        newBoostPrice = boostPrice();
    }
```
