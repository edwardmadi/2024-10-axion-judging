# Lack of Slippage Protection

### Summary

[_mintSellFarm](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV2AMO.sol#L342) is calling MasterAMO.sol's [_mintSellFarm](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/MasterAMO.sol#L199) function which call [addliquidity](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/MasterAMO.sol#L214) function and where slippage protection is not added, 
- In scenarios like this, an attacker can monitor the mempool for pending transactions and execute a frontrunning attack.
-  By observing an upcoming transaction, the attacker can manipulate the price before the protocol transaction is processed, causing the transaction to suffer significant slippage.
- As a result, the protocol could end up paying a much higher price or receiving a lower amount than intended, leading to a loss of funds.

- Additionally, since the transaction includes a `block.timestamp` as a deadline, a malicious node could intentionally delay its execution. 
- The attacker could then allow the transaction to proceed during a period of high market volatility or slippage, further increasing the potential loss for the protocol.

- The vulnerability arises from the ability of attackers to observe pending transactions in the mempool and manipulate the market conditions before those transactions are confirmed. 
- This exposure to frontrunning and time-based manipulation can lead to unfavorable execution terms and financial losses for the protocol.
