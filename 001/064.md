# Public mintSellFarm can be permanently DOSed due to bad check of V3 pool in _addLiquidity

### Summary

Public mintSellFarm can be permanently DOSed due to bad check of V3 pool in _addLiquidity. The title is similar to https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion-testing549/issues/8 but this is not a duplicate according to the rules. The code implementation and impact and fix are all different.

> Duplication rules

> The exception to this would be if underlying code implementations OR impact OR the fixes are different, then they may be treated separately.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV3AMO.sol#L186-L187

```solidity
        uint128 currentLiquidity = ISolidlyV3Pool(pool).liquidity();
        liquidity = (usdAmount * currentLiquidity) / IERC20Upgradeable(usd).balanceOf(pool);
```

The amount of liquidity to mint depends on the usd balance of the pool. This is wrong. The problem is similar to https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion-testing549/issues/8. Copied from there:

> Uni/Solidly V3 pools have concentrated liquidity and the balance of the tokens of the pool is not related to the price. When liquidity is added out of range, tokens of only one type can be added to the pool balance without moving the price. See uniswap docs. https://support.uniswap.org/hc/en-us/articles/20902968738317-What-is-single-sided-liquidity
> 
> Example: Uni v3 DAI/USDC pool has 36m dai and 37.2m usdc but the price is 1:1. https://app.uniswap.org/explore/pools/ethereum/0x5777d92f208679DB4b9778590Fa3CAB3aC9e2168

Here the problem is not adding single sided liquidity but that the same tokens can be used to add more liquidity units if they are added in a concentrated range than over the whole range.

Uni/Solidly V3 has invariant: adding same amount of tokens (A, B) over same range gives same amount of liquidity (check whitepaper page 2 https://app.uniswap.org/whitepaper-v3.pdf). The tokens of the pool do not matter. This calculation is wrong because that invariant is broken. If concentrated liquidity is added, the `.liquidity()` increases for less usd tokens than it took to add over the full range, which is what is done in the tests and presumably on mainnet. The calculated liquidity to add will be increased more than it should. This can cause permanent DOS because the required usd to obtain that much liquidity can be more than usdAmount. (This calculation will be wrong even if other users add normal liquidity with usd/boost in differing ratios.)

mintSellFarm will be DOSed as it adds liquidity with the full usd balance of the contract. https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/MasterAMO.sol#L213-L214
```solidity
            uint256 usdBalance = IERC20Upgradeable(usd).balanceOf(address(this));
            (boostSpent, usdSpent, liquidity) = _addLiquidity(usdBalance, minBoostSpend, minUsdSpend, deadline);
```

The admin can call addLiquidity manually and specify a lower usdAmount than what is calculated in mintSellFarm, which is the full balance. That involves difficult math or trial and error.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

Someone adds concentrated liquidity to V3 pool.

### Attack Path

Not an attack, but normal usage.

1. Start with example pool initially at 100 boost and 100 usd of liquidity over the full range owned by the protocol. Protocol receives some liquidity amount. At this point if _addLiquidity is called it will calculate that it needs the received liquidity amount (= total amount) if it wants to add 100 usd of liquidity over the full range.
2. User adds liquidity to pool over the 0.5-1.5 usd. The liquidity units here are cheaper per token than over the full range.
3. User buys boost and increases boost price to 1.1 usd.
4. _addLiquidity will calculate that it needs more liquidity than before if it wants to add 100 usd of liquidity over the full range because of `liquidity = (usdAmount * currentLiquidity) / IERC20Upgradeable(usd).balanceOf(pool);`, and disproportionate increase in currentLiquidity. This is greater than in step 1. The actual usd required to add this liquidity will be > 100. The problem is currentLiquidity has been inflated for cheaper than the protocol added due to concentrated liquidity.
5. mintSellFarm is now DOSed because it tries to add more usd than it has.

### Impact

Users cannot call mintSellFarm to restore the peg. The admin can call addLiquidity manually and specify a lower usdAmount than what is calculated in mintSellFarm. That involves difficult math or trial and error as well as repeatedly paying unnecessary gas fees. The admin/AMO bot may not know or be unable to do this math and the peg may be lost.

### PoC

Edit the test https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/test/SolidlyV3AMO.test.ts#L522-L553. See section with `// BEGIN ADDED LINES`.

```javascript
    describe("mintSellFarm", function() {
      it("Should execute mintSellFarm successfully when price is above 1", async function() {
        let limitSqrtPriceX96: bigint;
        const zeroForOne = usd2boost;
        if (zeroForOne) {
          limitSqrtPriceX96 = MIN_SQRT_RATIO + BigInt(10);
        } else {
          limitSqrtPriceX96 = MAX_SQRT_RATIO - BigInt(10);
        }
        const usdToBuy = ethers.parseUnits("1000000", 6);
        await testUSD.connect(admin).mint(user.address, usdToBuy);
        await testUSD.connect(user).approve(poolAddress, usdToBuy);
        await pool.connect(user).swap(
          user.address,
          zeroForOne,
          usdToBuy,
          limitSqrtPriceX96,
          1,
          deadline
        );

        
        // BEGIN ADDED LINES

        const boostToAdd = ethers.parseUnits("100000000", 18);
        await boost.connect(boostMinter).mint(user.address, boostToAdd);
        await boost.connect(user).approve(poolAddress, boostToAdd);
        const usdToAdd = ethers.parseUnits("100000000", 6);
        await testUSD.connect(boostMinter).mint(user.address, usdToAdd);
        await testUSD.connect(user).approve(poolAddress, usdToAdd);

        console.log(await pool.connect(user).liquidity());

        // add liquidity in the smaller range to increase uint128 currentLiquidity = ISolidlyV3Pool(pool).liquidity();
        // because .liquidity() only gives liquidity in range

        await pool.connect(user).mint(
          user.address,
          tickLower / 2,
          tickUpper / 2,
          ethers.parseUnits("10000000", 12),
          1,
          1,
          deadline
        );

        console.log(await pool.connect(user).liquidity());

        console.log(" user usd " + (await testUSD.connect(user).balanceOf(user)));
        // END ADDED LINES
        

        expect(await solidlyV3AMO.boostPrice()).to.be.gt(ethers.parseUnits("1.1", 6));
        await expect(solidlyV3AMO.connect(amo).mintSellFarm()).to.emit(solidlyV3AMO, "PublicMintSellFarmExecuted");
        expect(await solidlyV3AMO.boostPrice()).to.be.approximately(ethers.parseUnits(price, 6), 10);
        expect(await boost.balanceOf(amoAddress)).to.be.equal(0);
        expect(await testUSD.balanceOf(amoAddress)).to.be.lt(Math.floor(Number(usdToBuy) * errorTolerance));
      });
```

```

_addLiquidity failed because of this bug and mintSellFarm is DOSed. Line 585 is `await expect(solidlyV3AMO.connect(amo).mintSellFarm()).to.emit(solidlyV3AMO, "PublicMintSellFarmExecuted");`

The test should pass because adding liquidity does not change the price and so mintSellFarm should still be callable.
