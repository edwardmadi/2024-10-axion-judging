# `_addLiquidity` in `SolidlyV3AMO` calculates liquidity incorrectly

### Summary

Amount of liquidity to be added over tick interval is calculated incorrectly in `SolidlyV3AMO`

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV3AMO.sol#L187

### Root Cause

Consider the following code:

```solidity
        uint128 currentLiquidity = ISolidlyV3Pool(pool).liquidity();
        liquidity = (usdAmount * currentLiquidity) / IERC20Upgradeable(usd).balanceOf(pool);

        // Add liquidity to the BOOST-USD pool within the specified tick range
        (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1) = ISolidlyV3Pool(pool).mint(
            address(this),
            tickLower,
            tickUpper,
            uint128(liquidity),
            amount0Min,
            amount1Min,
            deadline
        );
```

First off, notice that we are using the `currentLiquidity` at the current active tick to calculate the amount of liquidity that we should provide over an entire tick range `tickLower` to `tickUpper`, which is just wrong (this could take more usd/BOOST than we have). 

Secondly, note that in this calculation: `liquidity = (usdAmount * currentLiquidity) / IERC20Upgradeable(usd).balanceOf(pool);`, the denominator is the `IERC20Upgradeable(usd).balanceOf(pool)` (i.e. the total amount of USD in the pool), which is also incorrect, because someone could be providing a bunch of USD liquidity at a specific tick that is completely out of range. 

In fact, if an attacker provides a bunch of useless stablecoin liquidity, the denominator could get so large that our calculated value of `liquidity` will be very low, effectively preventing us from providing liquidity.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Malicious attacker can provide a bunch of stablecoin liquidity at an out of range tick
2. This will drive `IERC20Upgradeable(usd).balanceOf(pool)` to a very high value, which means our calculated value of `liquidity` will be extremely low, so `_addLiquidity` (and thus `addLiquidity`) will essentially not work anymore

### Impact

Prevents providing meaningful liquidity through `SolidlyV3AMO`
