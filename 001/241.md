# Slippage is cuased to Loss of the funds

### Summary

The SolidlyV2AMO contract manages liquidity, minting, and swapping of BOOST and USD tokens within a decentralized protocol. It interacts with Solidly V2 liquidity pools to maintain price stability and collect rewards. However, a major concern arises from potential front-running and back-running attacks, where malicious actors could exploit price manipulation during liquidity operations. Inadequate slippage protection in critical functions could allow attackers to `manipulate prices`, causing the protocol to perform unfavorable swaps or liquidity provisions, leading to significant financial losses.

### Root Cause

- Inadequate Slippage Control: The contract does not consistently enforce strict slippage limits during token swaps and liquidity operations, especially in the _mintSellFarm() and similar functions, making it vulnerable to price manipulation.
- Reserve and Price Imbalance: Liquidity management functions like _addLiquidity() and _unfarmBuyBurn() may operate based on manipulated reserve ratios, causing the protocol to execute unfavorable liquidity operations.

### Mitigation

Implement stricter slippage thresholds for all swaps and liquidity operations to ensure the protocol does not perform operations under unfavorable conditions.
