# Vulnerability in mintSellFarm() Function Allows Sandwich Attack Exploit

### Summary

The mintSellFarm() function is susceptible to a sandwich attack due to insufficient slippage protection. The function calculates the expected USD output based on the amount of Boost tokens present but sets minUsdAmountOut to a hardcoded value of 1, which is extremely low. This low minimum output allows an attacker to manipulate the transaction by front-running and back-running it, potentially profiting from the price impact caused by the legitimate transaction.

### Root Cause

The root cause of this vulnerability is the hardcoded minUsdAmountOut value of 1 in the [_mintSellFarm() function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV3AMO.sol#L310). This low minimum output does not adequately protect against price fluctuations caused by sandwich attacks, leaving the protocol vulnerable.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

Front-running and Back-running Capabilities:

### Attack Path

1. A legitimate user calls the mintSellFarm() function.
2. The attacker front-runs this transaction by selling a large amount of Boost tokens, temporarily reducing the Boost price and increasing the USD price.
3. The legitimate transaction executes, with minUsdAmountOut set to 1, which allows the trade to proceed despite the manipulated price.
4. The attacker then back-runs the transaction by buying Boost tokens at a lower price, profiting from the manipulated price movements.

### Impact

The sandwich attack allows the attacker to profit from the price manipulation.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Implement Slippage Protection in `SolidlyV3AMO.sol::_mintSellFarm()`
