# incorrect calculation of liquidity amount

### Summary

Per the [ReadMe]( https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/README.md?plain=1#L111) :
>The unfarmBuyBurn function is used to increase BOOST price back to peg and is symmetrical to the MintSellFarm function. 

This means `mintSellFarm( )` and `unfarmBuyBurn()`  are mirror opposites . That is , `_mintSellFarm()`  lowers the BOOST price and  `unfarmBuyBurn( )` function is used to increase BOOST price back to peg.

However, due to an incorrect calculation of the liquidity amount in [unfarmBuyBurn( )](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/README.md?plain=1#L111), fewer liquidity tokens are removed from the pool. As a result, the BOOST price doesn't increase as much as intended, slowing down its return to peg.

### Root Cause

In [mintSellFarm( )](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/MasterAMO.sol#L219) which  bundles the [mintAndSell( )]( ) and  [addLiquidity( )]() function  , calculates the amount of  liquidity as `liquidity = (usdAmount * currentLiquidity) / IERC20Upgradeable(usd).balanceOf(pool)`  where `currentLiquidity = ISolidlyV3Pool(pool).liquidity()`   

The function  [mintSellFarm( )](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/MasterAMO.sol#L219) relies on [_addLiquidity( )](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/MasterAMO.sol#L214) to calculate the amount of liquidity required since they are bundled together as shown below  :


```solidity
 function mintSellFarm(
.....
.....
    )
        external
        override
        onlyRole(AMO_ROLE)
        whenNotPaused
        nonReentrant
        returns (uint256 boostAmountIn, uint256 usdAmountOut, uint256 boostSpent, uint256 usdSpent, uint256 liquidity)
    {
@>        (boostAmountIn, usdAmountOut, boostSpent, usdSpent, liquidity) = _mintSellFarm(
            boostAmount,
            minUsdAmountOut,
            minBoostSpend,
            minUsdSpend,
            deadline
        );
    }

...........

 function _mintSellFarm(
 .....
.....
        uint256 deadline
    )
        internal
        returns (uint256 boostAmountIn, uint256 usdAmountOut, uint256 boostSpent, uint256 usdSpent, uint256 liquidity)
    {
   .......
@>            (boostSpent, usdSpent, liquidity) = _addLiquidity(usdBalance, minBoostSpend, minUsdSpend, deadline);
        }
    }
```



In  [SolidlyV3AMO::_addLiquidity()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV3AMO.sol#L168):
```solidity
 function _addLiquidity(
        uint256 usdAmount,
        uint256 minBoostSpend,
        uint256 minUsdSpend,
        uint256 deadline
    ) internal override returns (uint256 boostSpent, uint256 usdSpent, uint256 liquidity) {
// Calculate the amount of liquidity required 
@>        uint128 currentLiquidity = ISolidlyV3Pool(pool).liquidity();
@>       liquidity = (usdAmount * currentLiquidity) / IERC20Upgradeable(usd).balanceOf(pool);
  
        // Add liquidity to the BOOST-USD pool within the specified tick range
        (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1) = ISolidlyV3Pool(pool).mint(
            address(this),
            tickLower,
            tickUpper,
@>       uint128(liquidity),
            amount0Min,
            amount1Min,
            deadline
        );

   .....
    }
```


When we take a look at the [unfarmBuyBurn( )](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/MasterAMO.sol#L251) function  , we  see that the liquidity  amount is calculated as `liquidity = (liquidity * LIQUIDITY_COEFF) / FACTOR;`  where `liquidity = (totalLiquidity * (boostBalance - usdBalance)) / (boostBalance + usdBalance);`  as shown below as it depends on [_unfarmBuyBurn()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV3AMO.sol#L319)


```solidity
  function _unfarmBuyBurn() internal override returns (uint256 liquidity, uint256 newBoostPrice) {
// get the total liquidity of pool  
      uint256 totalLiquidity = ISolidlyV3Pool(pool).liquidity();
// Get the total boost balance of pool       
 uint256 boostBalance = IERC20Upgradeable(boost).balanceOf(pool);
     // Get the scaled amount of usd in the pool
   uint256 usdBalance = toBoostAmount(IERC20Upgradeable(usd).balanceOf(pool)); // scaled
     .......


 @>       liquidity = (totalLiquidity * (boostBalance - usdBalance)) / (boostBalance + usdBalance);
  @>      liquidity = (liquidity * LIQUIDITY_COEFF) / FACTOR;

        _unfarmBuyBurn(
  @>          liquidity,
            1, // minBoostRemove
            1, // minUsdRemove
            1, // minBoostAmountOut
            block.timestamp + 1 // deadline
        );

        newBoostPrice = boostPrice();
    }
```

The  difference is that `_unfarmBuyBurn` calculates liquidity based on the difference between BOOST and USD balances in the pool, then further reduces this value by a scaling factor `FACTOR`. In contrast, `_addLiquidity`  calculates liquidity by directly scaling the USD amount by the ratio of current pool liquidity to the poolâ€™s USD balance, without applying a similar reduction. This leads to `_unfarmBuyBurn` removing significantly less liquidity than `_addLiquidity` adds, causing an asymmetry between the two operations.

As a result, the BOOST price will not  increase as much as intended, slowing down its return to peg.
