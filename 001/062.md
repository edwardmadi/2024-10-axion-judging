# Public unfarmBuyBurn can be permanently DOSed due to bad check of V3 pool

### Summary

Public unfarmBuyBurn can be permanently DOSed due to bad check of V3 pool. The title is similar to https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion-testing549/issues/9 but this is not a duplicate according to the rules. The code implementation and impact and fix are all different.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV3AMO.sol#L319-L323
```solidity

    function _unfarmBuyBurn() internal override returns (uint256 liquidity, uint256 newBoostPrice) {
        uint256 totalLiquidity = ISolidlyV3Pool(pool).liquidity();
        uint256 boostBalance = IERC20Upgradeable(boost).balanceOf(pool);
        uint256 usdBalance = toBoostAmount(IERC20Upgradeable(usd).balanceOf(pool)); // scaled
        if (boostBalance <= usdBalance) revert PriceNotInRange(boostPrice());

        liquidity = (totalLiquidity * (boostBalance - usdBalance)) / (boostBalance + usdBalance);
        liquidity = (liquidity * LIQUIDITY_COEFF) / FACTOR;
```
The function reverts if boostBalance <= usdBalance, assuming that it means 1 boost > 1 usd. This is wrong. Uni/Solidly V3 pools have concentrated liquidity and the balance of the tokens of the pool is not related to the price. When liquidity is added out of range, tokens of only one type can be added to the pool balance without moving the price. See uniswap docs. https://support.uniswap.org/hc/en-us/articles/20902968738317-What-is-single-sided-liquidity

Example: Uni v3 DAI/USDC pool has 36m dai and 37.2m usdc but the price is 1:1. https://app.uniswap.org/explore/pools/ethereum/0x5777d92f208679DB4b9778590Fa3CAB3aC9e2168

Normal users adding liquidity to the pool can cause this function to be DOSed. If someone adds a lot of liquidity out of range the DOS can become permanent.

The liquidity calculation immediately after this check is also wrong for the same reason.

### Internal pre-conditions

none

### External pre-conditions

User adds enough single sided usd liquidity to V3 pool.

### Attack Path

Not an attack, but normal usage.

1. Start with example pool at 101 boost to 100 usd over the full range. Price is 100/101 usd. unfarmBuyBurn should be possible.
2. User adds liquidity to pool over the price range 0.5 - 0.6 usd. Since the range is below the current price, only usd can be added. Tokens of 100 usd are added. Price does not change.
3. unfarmBuyBurn is now DOSed because 101 boost <= 200 usd.

### Impact

Users cannot call unfarmBuyBurn to restore the peg.

### PoC

Modify the test https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/test/SolidlyV3AMO.test.ts#L555-L587 as follows. See the `// lines added` comment.

```javascript
    describe("unfarmBuyBurn", function() {
      it("Should execute unfarmBuyBurn successfully when price is above 1", async function() {
        let limitSqrtPriceX96: bigint;
        const zeroForOne = boost2usd;
        if (zeroForOne) {
          limitSqrtPriceX96 = MIN_SQRT_RATIO + BigInt(10);
        } else {
          limitSqrtPriceX96 = MAX_SQRT_RATIO - BigInt(10);
        }
        const boostToBuy = ethers.parseUnits("1000000", 18);
        await boost.connect(boostMinter).mint(user.address, boostToBuy);
        await boost.connect(user).approve(poolAddress, boostToBuy);
        await pool.connect(user).swap(
          user.address,
          zeroForOne,
          boostToBuy,
          limitSqrtPriceX96,
          1,
          deadline
        );

        // lines added
        const usdToAdd = ethers.parseUnits("100000000", 6);
        await testUSD.connect(boostMinter).mint(user.address, usdToAdd);
        await testUSD.connect(user).approve(poolAddress, usdToAdd);

        console.log(await testUSD.connect(user).balanceOf(poolAddress));
        await pool.connect(user).mint(
          user.address,
          -310000,
          -300000,
          ethers.parseUnits("100000000", 12),
          0,
          1,
          deadline
        );
        console.log(await testUSD.connect(user).balanceOf(poolAddress));
        // end lines added

        expect(await solidlyV3AMO.boostPrice()).to.be.lt(ethers.parseUnits("0.9", 6));
        await expect(solidlyV3AMO.connect(amo).unfarmBuyBurn()).to.emit(solidlyV3AMO, "PublicUnfarmBuyBurnExecuted");
        expect(await solidlyV3AMO.boostPrice()).to.be.approximately(ethers.parseUnits(price, 6), 10);
        expect(await boost.balanceOf(amoAddress)).to.be.equal(0);
        expect(await testUSD.balanceOf(amoAddress)).to.be.lt(
          Math.floor(Number(boostToBuy) * (10 ** 6 - Number(usdUsageRatio)) / 10 ** 18));
      });
```

Result

```text
    Public AMO Functions
      unfarmBuyBurn
9090991736293n
21135876012282n
        1) Should execute unfarmBuyBurn successfully when price is above 1
        âœ” Should revert unfarmBuyBurn when price is 1
      

  1) SolidlyV3AMO
       Public AMO Functions
         unfarmBuyBurn
           Should execute unfarmBuyBurn successfully when price is above 1:
     Error: VM Exception while processing transaction: reverted with custom error 'PriceNotInRange(826461)'
```

Price is less than 0.9 but unfarmBuyBurn reverts.

The test should pass because adding liquidity does not change the price and so unfarmBuyBurn should still be callable.

### Mitigation

Remove the check and use the check only in parameterized _unfarmBuyBurn. The liquidity calculation is also wrong as it will underflow. Try using quoteSwap instead to find how much liquidity should be removed and used to buy boost.
