# Lack of slippage protection leads to loss of protocol funds

### Summary

- There is no slippage protection while adding liquidity to AMM.
- In `SolidityV2AMO.sol` :
```solidity
function _mintSellFarm() internal override returns (uint256 liquidity, uint256 newBoostPrice) {
...
        (, , , , liquidity) = _mintSellFarm(
            boostAmountIn,
            toUsdAmount(boostAmountIn), // minUsdAmountOut
            1, // minBoostSpend
            1, // minUsdSpend
            block.timestamp + 1 // deadline
        );
...
    }
```
- Above function calls `_mintSellFarm` function of `MasterAMO.sol` in which `_addLiquidity` function is called which adds liquidity in AMM and where slippage protection is missing.

- In `MasterAMO.sol`
```solidity
function _mintSellFarm(
        uint256 boostAmount,
        uint256 minUsdAmountOut,
        uint256 minBoostSpend,
        uint256 minUsdSpend,
        uint256 deadline
    )
        internal
        returns (uint256 boostAmountIn, uint256 usdAmountOut, uint256 boostSpent, uint256 usdSpent, uint256 liquidity)
    {
       ...
            (boostSpent, usdSpent, liquidity) = _addLiquidity(usdBalance, minBoostSpend, minUsdSpend, deadline);
        }
    }
```
- In such cases, an attacker can frontrun the transaction by seeing it in the mempool and manipulate the price such that protocol transaction have to bear heavy slippage which will leads to loss of protocol funds.
- Also, there is block.timestamp as deadline so malicious node can prevent transaction to execute temporary and execute the transaction when there is high slippage which will also leads to loss of protocol funds.


### Root Cause

- In `SolidlyV2AMO.sol::_mintSellFarm` function parameter of minBoostSpend and minUsdSpend are set to 1 and 1 which will cause slippage. Also in deadline it set block.timestamp + 1.

### Impact

- Loss of protocol funds due to non-protection of slippage.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Protocol should implement slippage protection and set deadline while adding liquidity to AMM.
