# SolidlyV2AMO.sol :: _mintAndSellBoost() will always revert when used with Fee-on-Transfer (FoT) tokens as collateral.

### Summary

**`_mintAndSellBoost()`** verifies if **`usdAmountOut != usdBalanceAfter - usdBalanceBefore`** . If they don’t match, the transaction reverts. However, with Fee-on-Transfer (FoT) tokens, the balance difference will always be smaller than **`usdAmountOut`** due to the transfer fee applied when tokens are transfered from the DEX to the contract. As a result, the transaction always reverts.

### Root Cause

[_mintAndSellBoost()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/3704f19ea52ebe255861ded3da0d3648c764fb69/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV2AMO.sol#L187-L188) is implemented as follows.
```Solidity
function _mintAndSellBoost(
        uint256 boostAmount,
        uint256 minUsdAmountOut,
        uint256 deadline
    ) internal override returns (uint256 boostAmountIn, uint256 usdAmountOut) {
        // Mint the specified amount of BOOST tokens
        IMinter(boostMinter).protocolMint(address(this), boostAmount);

        // Approve the transfer of BOOST tokens to the router
        IERC20Upgradeable(boost).approve(router, boostAmount);

        // Define the route to swap BOOST tokens for USD tokens
        ISolidlyRouter.route[] memory routes = new ISolidlyRouter.route[](1);
        routes[0] = ISolidlyRouter.route(boost, usd, true);

        if (minUsdAmountOut < toUsdAmount(boostAmount)) minUsdAmountOut = toUsdAmount(boostAmount);

        uint256 usdBalanceBefore = balanceOfToken(usd);
        // Execute the swap and store the amounts of tokens involved
        uint256[] memory amounts = ISolidlyRouter(router).swapExactTokensForTokens(
            boostAmount,
            minUsdAmountOut,
            routes,
            address(this),
            deadline
        );
        
        uint256 usdBalanceAfter = balanceOfToken(usd);
        boostAmountIn = amounts[0];
        usdAmountOut = amounts[1];

        // we check that selling BOOST yields proportionally more USD
@>      if (usdAmountOut != usdBalanceAfter - usdBalanceBefore)
            revert UsdAmountOutMismatch(usdAmountOut, usdBalanceAfter - usdBalanceBefore);

        if (usdAmountOut < minUsdAmountOut) revert InsufficientOutputAmount(usdAmountOut, minUsdAmountOut);

        emit MintSell(boostAmount, usdAmountOut);
    }
```
As you can see, the function checks if **`usdAmountOut != usdBalanceAfter - usdBalanceBefore`** and reverts if the condition is true. 

With Fee-on-Transfer (FoT) tokens, the transaction will always revert because **`usdAmountOut`** reflects the amount received directly from the swap, but it doesn’t account for the fee charged when transferring tokens from the DEX to the contract. This causes **`usdBalanceAfter - usdBalanceBefore`** to always be less than **`usdAmountOut`**, resulting in the transaction being reverted.

To verify the transaction, [swapExactTokensForTokens()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/3704f19ea52ebe255861ded3da0d3648c764fb69/liquidity-amo/contracts/mock/MockRouter.sol#L528) calls [getAmountsOut()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/3704f19ea52ebe255861ded3da0d3648c764fb69/liquidity-amo/contracts/mock/MockRouter.sol#L238) in the pair contract to determine the **`amountOut`**.

Reference: https://ftmscan.com/address/0x6eB4Eb157C3e6f0576b8ba3C88e8C5D2e6E81D17#code#L889
```Solidity
function getAmountOut(uint amountIn, address tokenIn) external view returns (uint) {
        (uint _reserve0, uint _reserve1) = (reserve0, reserve1);
        amountIn -= amountIn * IPairFactory(factory).getFee(stable) / 10000; // remove fee from amount received
        return _getAmountOut(amountIn, tokenIn, _reserve0, _reserve1);
    }
```
Here, we can see that the transfer fee is effectively deducted from the input amount, but let’s take a closer look at what happens in **`_getAmountOut()`**.

Reference: https://ftmscan.com/address/0x6eB4Eb157C3e6f0576b8ba3C88e8C5D2e6E81D17#code#L895
```Solidity
function _getAmountOut(uint amountIn, address tokenIn, uint _reserve0, uint _reserve1) internal view returns (uint) {
        if (stable) {
            uint xy =  _k(_reserve0, _reserve1);
            _reserve0 = _reserve0 * 1e18 / decimals0;
            _reserve1 = _reserve1 * 1e18 / decimals1;
            (uint reserveA, uint reserveB) = tokenIn == token0 ? (_reserve0, _reserve1) : (_reserve1, _reserve0);
            amountIn = tokenIn == token0 ? amountIn * 1e18 / decimals0 : amountIn * 1e18 / decimals1;
            uint y = reserveB - _get_y(amountIn+reserveA, xy, reserveB);
            return y * (tokenIn == token0 ? decimals1 : decimals0) / 1e18;
        } else {
            (uint reserveA, uint reserveB) = tokenIn == token0 ? (_reserve0, _reserve1) : (_reserve1, _reserve0);
            return amountIn * reserveB / (reserveA + amountIn);
        }
    }
```
As you can see, the function returns the **`amountOut`** from the swap, but it doesn’t account for the transfer fee, since it’s a swap, not a transfer. However, the developers compare this **`amountOut`** with **`balanceAfter`** and **`balanceBefore`**, which will always result in a mismatch due to the transfer fee being deducted.

As you can see in the contest specifications, Fee-on-Transfer (FoT) tokens are within the scope.
>If you are integrating tokens, are you allowing only whitelisted tokens to work with the codebase or any complying with the standard? Are they assumed to have certain properties, e.g. be non-reentrant? Are there any types of [weird tokens](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20) you want to integrate?

>Yes, the AMO are deployed by the team, with a specific stablecoin as a pair!
In the the scope of this audit would be any USD-pegged token, beside fee-on-transfer ones.

### Internal pre-conditions

Using Fee-on-Transfer (FoT) Tokens as collateral.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

None.

### Impact

The transactions will always revert, making it impossible to call **`_mintAndSellBoost()`**, which breaks one of the core functionalities of the protocol.

### PoC

To better understand the issue, consider this example:

Preconditions: **`usdBalanceBefore = 0`** and a 10% transfer fee for the Fee-on-Transfer (FoT) token.

1. The collateral token is a Fee-on-Transfer (FoT) token.
1. **`_mintAndSellBoost()`** is called in **`SolidlyV2AMO.sol`** with **`boostAmount = 100`**.
1. The **`boostAmount`** is swapped for the FoT token.
1. **`usdAmountOut = 100`** (assuming a 1:1 ratio for simplicity), and the FoT token is transferred to the contract, but due to the 10% fee, only 90 tokens are received (100 - 10 = 90).
1. The condition **`usdAmountOut != usdBalanceAfter - usdBalanceBefore`** is checked, resulting in 100 != 90 - 0.
1. -The transaction reverts with the custom error **`UsdAmountOutMismatch()`**.

### Mitigation

There isn’t a simple solution if the developers want to keep this check. One possible approach is to deduct the transfer fee from **`usdAmountOut`** and then compare it to **`usdBalanceAfter - usdBalanceBefore`**.
