# `_unfarmBuyBurn` function in `SolidlyV2AMO` makes several incorrect assumptions, leading it to possibly revert

### Summary

The `_unfarmBuyBurn()` in `SolidlyV2AMO` makes several incorrect assumptions, leading it to possibly revert 

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV2AMO.sol#L358

In `_unfarmBuyBurn` in `SolidlyV2AMO`, consider the following logic:

```solidity
        uint256 usdNeeded = (((boostReserve - usdReserve) / 2) * usdBuyRatio) / FACTOR;
        uint256 totalLp = IERC20Upgradeable(pool).totalSupply();
        liquidity = (usdNeeded * totalLp) / usdReserve;
```

Notice that the liquidity is computed using the total amount of `usdNeeded` (which is just computed using the reserves). There are two issues here - first, it is possible for `usdNeeded > usdReserve`, in which case we try to withdraw and burn more liquidity than is in the pool. This causes it to revert. Secondly, we are making a bold assumption that we actually own `liquidity` LP tokens that we can burn; in fact, if there are other liquidity providers, this computation could lead us to a place where `liquidity` is always larger than the amount of liquidity the AMO owns. This will again cause the code to revert.   

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

Either we must arrive at a state where boostReserve is much larger than usdReserve so we end up having usdNeeded > usdReserve, or there are enough other liquidity providers so that we try to correct the price too much and attempt to burn more liquidity than we own.
