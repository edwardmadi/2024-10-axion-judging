# Inadequate Slippage Control for USD to BOOST Swaps

### Summary

The contract lacks slippage control for USD to BOOST swaps due to the absence of a `minBoostAmountOut` parameter.

### Root Cause

In [SolidlyV3AMO.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV3AMO.sol#L130-L151), the implementation of the swap function does not include a check for a minimum amount of BOOST tokens (`minBoostAmountOut`) to be received during swaps from USD to BOOST. This oversight leads to situations where the contract could receive an unsatisfactory amount of BOOST due to price slippage or low liquidity.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. **Admin needs to call `setParams()` to set `usdUsageRatio` to be at most `FACTOR`.**

2. **AMO_ROLE needs to execute a swap using the `_mintAndSellBoost()` function to set `targetSqrtPriceX96` to be exactly the current market price.**

3. **Liquidity in the pool must be low enough that executing the swap with the given `boostAmount` results in slippage that reduces the received `boostAmount` below acceptable limits.**



### External pre-conditions

1. **The liquidity in the Solidly V3 pool must decrease significantly, causing slippage to increase when executing swaps involving BOOST and USD.**

2. **The market price of BOOST must be highly volatile, fluctuating rapidly, which can result in a situation where the price at execution deviates significantly from the `targetSqrtPriceX96`.** 

### Attack Path


1. **An admin calls the `setParams()` function** to set `usdUsageRatio` to a value close to `FACTOR`, allowing the contract to accept a higher amount of USD for swapping, which may not align with the available liquidity.

2. **An AMO_ROLE holder executes the `_mintAndSellBoost()` function**, specifying a large `boostAmount` to be swapped for USD without considering the current market conditions or liquidity in the Solidly V3 pool.

3. **During the swap, the market price of BOOST is highly volatile**, leading to a significant slippage event where the received amount of BOOST is much lower than anticipated, due to low liquidity or unfavorable market conditions.

4. **The transaction completes without any slippage checks in place for the amount of BOOST received**, resulting in the contract obtaining an insufficient amount of BOOST tokens in return for the USD spent.

5. **Subsequent transactions relying on the now reduced BOOST holdings may fail or yield undesirable outcomes**, affecting the overall strategy of liquidity management in the contract and potentially leading to financial losses. 

### Impact

The protocol suffers an approximate loss of 5% of the liquidity when performing swaps due to insufficient slippage control. The attacker gains this 5% from the liquidity pool, resulting in financial instability for other users relying on the correct liquidity balance. This could lead to further issues, such as reduced trading capabilities and diminished trust in the protocol's effectiveness.

### Mitigation

Implement a `minBoostAmountOut` parameter in the swap function for USD to BOOST transactions.
