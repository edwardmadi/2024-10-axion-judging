# There is no proper Slippage and deadline protection

### Summary

Whenever mintSellFarm() function is called , _mintSellFarm() is called internally which is there in SolidlyV2AMO.sol 
Here deadline is set as (block.timestamp + 1) and also minBoostSpend and minUsdSpend is set to 1. Alsp in _unfarmBuyburn deadline is set to block.timestamp + 1. which is also wrong



### Root Cause

Passing block.timestamp as the expiry/deadline of an operation does not mean "require immediate execution" - it means "whatever block this transaction appears in, I'm comfortable with that block's timestamp". Providing this value means that a malicious miner can hold the transaction for as long as they like (think the flashbots mempool for bundling transactions), which may be until they are able to cause the transaction to incur the maximum amount of slippage allowed by the slippage parameter, or until conditions become unfavorable enough that other orders, e.g. liquidations, are triggered. Timestamps should be chosen off-chain, and should be specified by the caller to avoid unnecessary MEV.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact


for slippage related bug parameter which are passed in _mintsellFarm is passed in _addLiquidity

  (boostSpent, usdSpent, liquidity) = _addLiquidity(usdBalance, minBoostSpend, minUsdSpend, deadline);
  
 this could lead to max sllipage as min is set 1 in both parameters.
 
 and this are sent to 
 
 (boostSpent, usdSpent, liquidity) = ISolidlyRouter(router).addLiquidity(
            boost,
            usd,
            true,
            boostAmount,
            usdAmount,
            minBoostSpend,
            minUsdSpend,
            address(this),
            deadline
        );
        
this can be as low as 1. which can exploit by frontrunning and backrunning .
So boost to usdt tokens swap could lead to slippage

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

take deadline and min Amount as parameter and that should be passed in _addliquidity functions and no hardcoded should be there. So proper protection should be there.
