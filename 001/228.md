# `mintAndSellBoost()` may revert due to swap fees.


### Summary

During `mintAndSellBoost()` of the AMO contracts, the Boost/USD price is expected to be larger than 1. The current code has a check that: `swapped out USD amount >= swapped in Boost amount`.

However, this constraint is too strict, and may cause DoS in some cases.

### Root Cause

In most of the cases, the constraint makes sense, since if Boost/USD price is larger than 1, an amount of Boost would be equivalent to a larger amount of USD.

However, since we are performing swaps in UniV2/UniV3, we must consider the fees. The constraint may break for some cases.

When fees are enabled. The amount of output USD is calculated with input Boost minus the fees. Example: Boost/USD price is 1.005, fee is 1%, we swap 10000 Boost, the amount of USD we would get is `10000 * (1 - 1%) * 1.005 == 9949.5`, which would actually be lesser than Boost. (Note that for simplicity we assume the swap is executed in a simple buy/sell order, and not an AMM swap).

SolidlyV3AMO.sol
```solidity
    function _mintAndSellBoost(
        uint256 boostAmount,
        uint256 minUsdAmountOut,
        uint256 deadline
    ) internal override returns (uint256 boostAmountIn, uint256 usdAmountOut) {
        ...
        (int256 amount0, int256 amount1) = ISolidlyV3Pool(pool).swap(
            address(this),
            boost < usd,
            int256(boostAmount), // Amount of BOOST tokens being swapped
            targetSqrtPriceX96, // The target square root price
            minUsdAmountOut, // Minimum acceptable amount of USD to receive from the swap
            deadline
        );
        ...

        (int256 boostDelta, int256 usdDelta) = sortAmounts(amount0, amount1);
        boostAmountIn = uint256(boostDelta); // BOOST tokens used in the swap
        usdAmountOut = uint256(-usdDelta); // USD tokens received from the swap
@>      if (toBoostAmount(usdAmountOut) <= boostAmountIn)
@>          revert InsufficientOutputAmount({outputAmount: toBoostAmount(usdAmountOut), minRequired: boostAmountIn});
        ...
    }

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `mintAndSellBoost()` is called

### External pre-conditions

1. Fees are enabled for swap.

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

The `mintAndSellBoost()` function may revert when it shouldn't.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Instead of checking the token amounts, change the check into a boost price check after the swap occurs.
