# Missing Check for Full Utilization of USD Removed in _unfarmBuyBurn Function

### Summary

The _unfarmBuyBurn function in the SolidlyV2AMO contract has a missing check to ensure that all USD tokens removed from liquidity (usdRemoved) are fully utilized in the swap (usdAmountIn). This could result in leftover USD tokens remaining in the contract if the full amount is not swapped, leading to inefficient operations and potentially unexpected behavior. Adding a validation for usdRemoved == usdAmountIn can help prevent this issue and ensure complete usage of tokens.

### Attack Path

### Impact

The impact of failing to check that usdRemoved == usdAmountIn in the _unfarmBuyBurn() function could result in leftover USD tokens being stuck in the contract. This could create discrepancies in accounting and inefficiencies in fund management. Specifically, funds meant to be fully swapped for BOOST tokens might remain unused in the contract, leading to reduced liquidity for the protocol and an incomplete execution of the burn process. In a worst-case scenario, this could harm the protocol's ability to maintain token price stability.

### Mitigation

check and and make sure usdRemoved == usdAmountIn
