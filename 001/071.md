# Lack of Balance Consistency and Output Validation Checks in _unfarmBuyBurn Function

### Summary

The `_unfarmBuyBurn` function in the `SolidlyV2AMO` contract lacks balance consistency checks and output validation, which are present in the `_mintAndSellBoost` function. Without these checks, the function may not detect discrepancies between the expected and actual token amounts after swaps or burns. This could result in financial loss due to slippage, incorrect token burns, or accounting errors.

### Root Cause

The `_unfarmBuyBurn` function in the `SolidlyV2AMO` contract does not include proper balance consistency checks or output validation, similar to those present in the _mintAndSellBoost function. Specifically, it does not verify that the expected token amounts match the actual changes in token balances after token transfers or swaps, potentially leading to incorrect operations due to slippage, and miscalculations.

```solidity
    function _unfarmBuyBurn(

........

        // Execute the swap and store the amounts of tokens involved
        uint256[] memory amounts = ISolidlyRouter(router).swapExactTokensForTokens(
            usdRemoved,
            minBoostAmountOut,
            routes,
            address(this),
            deadline
        );

        // Burn the BOOST tokens received from the liquidity
        // Burn the BOOST tokens received from the swap
        usdAmountIn = amounts[0];
        boostAmountOut = amounts[1];
        IBoostStablecoin(boost).burn(boostRemoved + boostAmountOut);

        emit UnfarmBuyBurn(boostRemoved, usdRemoved, liquidity, boostAmountOut);
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The `_unfarmBuyBurn` function performs token transfers, burns, or swaps involving BOOST and/or USD tokens.
2. There are no checks to validate that the amount of tokens bought or burned matches the changes in balances.
3. The function assumes the token transfer or swap succeeds without errors or slippage.

### External pre-conditions

1. Market volatility or liquidity constraints exist that could cause slippage during swaps or transfers.
2. A malicious user or external contract can influence or manipulate the behavior of the swap by affecting the pool's liquidity or token reserves.
3. Tokens involved (such as BOOST or USD) have different decimals, which could lead to rounding errors or miscalculations.

### Attack Path

1. `AMO` initiates the `_unfarmBuyBurn` function, expecting it to burn or swap tokens as intended.
2. Due to slippage or unexpected behavior in the swap, the actual amount of tokens received (or burned) does not match the expected output.
3. Without a check to verify the actual token balance changes, the contract continues execution as if the operation was successful.
4. The discrepancy between the expected and actual token amounts can result in underburning of tokens.

### Impact

The protocol or its users could receive fewer tokens than expected due to slippage, resulting in financial loss. When tokens are not burned as intended, it will lead to inflationary effects, where more tokens remain in circulation than expected.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement checks to validate that the actual balance changes in `_unfarmBuyBurn` match the expected token amounts after the swap or burn operation, similar to the checks in `_mintAndSellBoost`. And ensure that the function reverts if the amount of tokens received after a swap is below a defined threshold.

```solidity
uint256 boostBalanceBefore = balanceOfToken(boost);

// Execute swap or burn operation

uint256 boostBalanceAfter = balanceOfToken(boost);

// Check if the balance changes match expected outcomes

if (boostBalanceAfter - boostBalanceBefore != expectedBoostAmount) {
    revert BoostAmountMismatch(expectedBoostAmount, boostBalanceAfter - boostBalanceBefore);
}

if (boostAmountOut < minBoostAmountOut) revert InsufficientOutputAmount(boostAmountOut, minBoostAmountOut);
```
