# Function mint in Minter.sol is incompatible with fee-on transfer or rebase tokens

### Summary

There is a function in the `Minter.sol` contract that allows for manual minting of the `BOOST` token and transfers the corresponding collateral into the Treasury.

By pairing `BOOST` with a fee-on transfer or rebase token, the transferred collateral or backing could be understated or overstated resulting to a miscalculation in the value/supply of the `BOOST` token.

### Root Cause

The aforementioned function is located at:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/Minter.sol#L77-L85

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The `BOOST` token is paired with a fee-on transfer or rebase token.

### External pre-conditions

1. Not applicable

### Attack Path

1. Pairing with a fee-on transfer or rebase token upon initialization or changing the collateral via the `setTokens` function.
2. Manually calling the `mint` function in the `Minter.sol` contract.

### Impact

The `BOOST` collateral or backing could be understated or overstated resulting to an unintended price/token supply calculation.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider creating a safeguard for fee-on transfer or rebase tokens to prevent unintended results, or explicitly declaring the results when pairing with such tokens.
