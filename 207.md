# Missing Solidly V3 callbacks functionality

### Summary

Solidly V3 forks expect that the `msg.sender` is implementing a callbacks for certain pool operations like `mint` and `swap`.
```solidity
/// @title Callback for ISolidlyV3PoolActions#swap
/// @notice Any contract that calls ISolidlyV3PoolActions#swap must implement this interface
interface ISolidlyV3SwapCallback {
    /// @notice Called to `msg.sender` after executing a swap via ISolidlyV3Pool#swap.
    /// @dev In the implementation you must pay the pool tokens owed for the swap.
    /// The caller of this method must be checked to be a SolidlyV3Pool deployed by the canonical SolidlyV3Factory.
    /// amount0Delta and amount1Delta can both be 0 if no tokens were swapped.
    /// @param amount0Delta The amount of token0 that was sent (negative) or must be received (positive) by the pool by
    /// the end of the swap. If positive, the callback must send that amount of token0 to the pool.
    /// @param amount1Delta The amount of token1 that was sent (negative) or must be received (positive) by the pool by
    /// the end of the swap. If positive, the callback must send that amount of token1 to the pool.
    /// @param data Any data passed through by the caller via the ISolidlyV3PoolActions#swap call
    function solidlyV3SwapCallback(int256 amount0Delta, int256 amount1Delta, bytes calldata data) external;
}
```

```solidity
function _swap(
        address recipient,
        bool zeroForOne,
        int256 amountSpecified,
        uint160 sqrtPriceLimitX96,
        bytes calldata data
    ) private returns (int256 amount0, int256 amount1) {
        (amount0, amount1) = _swapBase(recipient, zeroForOne, amountSpecified, sqrtPriceLimitX96);

        // do the transfers and collect payment
        if (zeroForOne) {
            if (amount1 < 0) TransferHelper.safeTransfer(token1, recipient, uint256(-amount1));

            uint256 balance0Before = balance0();
            // msg.sender should implement solidlyV3SwapCallback() if it is a contract.
            ISolidlyV3SwapCallback(msg.sender).solidlyV3SwapCallback(amount0, amount1, data);
            require(balance0Before.add(uint256(amount0)) <= balance0(), 'IIA');
        } else {
            if (amount0 < 0) TransferHelper.safeTransfer(token0, recipient, uint256(-amount0));

            uint256 balance1Before = balance1();
            ISolidlyV3SwapCallback(msg.sender).solidlyV3SwapCallback(amount0, amount1, data);
            require(balance1Before.add(uint256(amount1)) <= balance1(), 'IIA');
        }

        slot0.unlocked = true;
    }
```

### Root Cause

Missing callback implementations.
