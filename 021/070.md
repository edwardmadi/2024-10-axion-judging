# `SolidlyV2/3AMO.sol` can be overtaken by malicious actor

### Summary

In the contracts implement Openzeppelin’s UUPS model, uninitialized implementation contract can be taken over by an attacker with `initialize` function, it’s recommended to invoke the _disableInitializers function in the constructor to prevent the implementation contract from being used by the attacker. However the contracts which are implementing `MasterAMO.sol` do not call _disableInitializers in the constructors.

### Root Cause

Contracts in context:
[MasterAMO.sol#L94](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/MasterAMO.sol#L94)
```solidity
abstract contract MasterAMO is
    IMasterAMO,
    Initializable,
    AccessControlEnumerableUpgradeable,
    PausableUpgradeable,
    ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable
{...}
```
[SolidlyV2AMO.sol#L60](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV2AMO.sol#L60)
```solidity
contract SolidlyV2AMO is ISolidlyV2AMO, MasterAMO {...}
```
[SolidlyV3AMO.sol#L50](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV3AMO.sol#L50)
```solidity
contract SolidlyV3AMO is ISolidlyV3AMO, MasterAMO {...}
```

### Mitigation

Invoke _disableInitializers in the constructors of contracts which implement `MasterAMO.sol` and thus it's upgradable features (the above mentioned abstract contract is in scope of the fix as well). As of example:
