# `notifyRewardAmounts` is vulnurable to approval race condition which an attacker can use to steal funds

### Summary

Performing a direct overwrite of the value in the allowances mapping is susceptible to front-running scenarios by an attacker (e.g., an approved spender). an attacker could spend both the previous and new allowances limits.

### Root Cause

no use of the safeIncreaseAllowance and the safeDecreaseAllowance methods from the [OpenZeppelin’s SafeERC20 library](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/api/token/erc20#SafeERC20).
