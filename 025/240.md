# Codebase is not compatible with ERC1504.


### Summary

According to the contest README, the codebase should use ERC1504 for upgradability. However, the codebase uses transparent proxy upgrades instead.

> Q: Is the codebase expected to comply with any EIPs? Can there be/are there any deviations from the specification?

> Strictly compliant: ERC-1504: Upgradable Smart Contract

### Root Cause

ERC-1504 is an ERC upgradable smart contracts: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1504.

To use it, the contract must be split to a handler contract (for implementation logic), and a data contract (for data storage).

However, the current implemnetation does not follow this at all, and uses the transparent proxy upgrade pattern instead. For example:

```solidity
abstract contract MasterAMO is
    IMasterAMO,
    Initializable,
    AccessControlEnumerableUpgradeable,
    PausableUpgradeable,
    ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable
{
	...
}
```
