# ERC-1504 Non-Compliance Despite README Specification

### Summary

The codebase fails to comply with ERC-1504 standard for upgradeable smart contracts, despite the README explicitly stating that the codebase is expected to be "Strictly compliant: ERC-1504: Upgradable Smart Contract".

### Root Cause

In the [README.md file](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/d75df3636ea28dd627d548d5d473c5d5477b0dc6/README.md?plain=1#L44-L45), under the Q&A section, it is stated:

```markdown
### Q: Is the codebase expected to comply with any EIPs? Can there be/are there any deviations from the specification?
Strictly compliant: ERC-1504: Upgradable Smart Contract
```

However `liquidity-amo/contracts/MasterAMO.sol` does not follow the [ERC-1504 specification](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1504#specification). The contract lacks the required structure and functions specified by ERC-1504: `implementation()`, `upgradeTo(address)`, `upgradeToAndCall(address, bytes)`.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The README specifies ERC-1504 compliance.
2. The actual implementation in the smart contracts does not follow ERC-1504 specifications.
