# No access controls on `MasterAMO::mintSellFarm`

### Summary

The missing check in will cause no restrictions on function access which will make anybody able to call the function

### Root Cause

In [MasterAMO.sol::278](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/MasterAMO.sol#L278) there are no access control checks 

### Internal pre-conditions

none

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

Any Account with No role should call `mintSellFarm()`

### Impact

Any account can access the function, Even though the specifications says otherwise i.e "Can only be called by an account with the AMO_ROLE when the contract is not paused"

### PoC

from the snippet below we can see that there is no modifier restricting access like in other contracts where you can find `onlyRole(AMO_ROLE)`. This makes the function accessible to anyone.
```solidity
    function mintSellFarm()
        external
        override
        whenNotPaused
        nonReentrant
        validateSwap(SELL_BOOST)
        returns (uint256 liquidity, uint256 newBoostPrice)
    {
```

Meanwhile this function should not be accessible to everyone considering the sensitivity of the functionality and as indicated in the natspec:"Can only be called by an account with the AMO_ROLE when the contract is not paused".

### Mitigation

Make sure only accounts with AMO_ROLE can have access
```diff
-    function mintSellFarm() external override whenNotPaused nonReentrant validateSwap(SELL_BOOST) returns (uint256 liquidity, uint256 newBoostPrice){

+ function mintSellFarm() external override onlyRole(AMO_ROLE) whenNotPaused nonReentrant validateSwap(SELL_BOOST) returns (uint256 liquidity, uint256 newBoostPrice){
```
