# Division by Zero Risk in Mint Function

### Summary

The division operation in the `mint` function can lead to a division by zero or unintended large values making the minting always to revert hence a DOS 

### Root Cause

This occurs when `boostDecimals` is less than `collateralDecimals`, resulting in a scenario where the division factor becomes invalid.

In the [mint](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/Minter.sol#L77-L85) function of the Minter contract, there is a risk associated with the division operation used to adjust the collateral amount being transferred. The relevant code snippet is as follows:
```solidity
function mint(address to, uint256 amount) external whenNotPaused onlyContract onlyRole(MINTER_ROLE) {
    IERC20Upgradeable(collateralAddress).safeTransferFrom(
        msg.sender,
        treasury,
        amount / (10 ** (boostDecimals - collateralDecimals))
    );
    IBoostStablecoin(boostAddress).mint(to, amount);
    emit TokenMinted(msg.sender, to, amount);
}
```
In this code, the line:
```solidity
amount / (10 ** (boostDecimals - collateralDecimals))
```
is intended to adjust the `amount` being transferred based on the decimal precision of the boost and collateral tokens. However, if `boostDecimals` is less than `collateralDecimals`, this will result in a division by zero, causing the transaction to revert. This can also lead to unintended large values if the decimal adjustment is improperly calculated.

### Internal pre-conditions


1. **Admin needs to call `setTokens()` to set `boostDecimals` to be less than `collateralDecimals`.**

2. **Admin needs to call `setTokens()` to set `collateralAddress` to be a valid ERC20 token that has a higher decimal precision than the token at `boostAddress`.**

3. **Admin needs to call `setTokens()` to set `boostAddress` to be a valid ERC20 token that has lower decimal precision than the token at `collateralAddress`.**

4. **Minter needs to call `mint()` while `amount` is a valid positive integer that is intended for minting but could trigger the division.**

5. **Caller of `mint()` needs to have a sufficient balance and allowance for `collateralAddress` to proceed with the `safeTransferFrom()` call.**


### External pre-conditions


1. **The ERC20 token at `collateralAddress` needs to have its decimals set to a value greater than that of the ERC20 token at `boostAddress`.**

2. **The `collateralAddress` ERC20 token needs to maintain its contract state such that its decimal precision does not change after being set.**

3. **The `boostAddress` ERC20 token needs to maintain its contract state such that its decimal precision does not change after being set.**


### Attack Path


   - An admin misconfigures the `Minter` contract by calling `setTokens()` and sets the `boostDecimals` to a value less than `collateralDecimals`. This allows for a division operation that could lead to a division by zero or unintended large values.
   - A user or authorized minter calls the `mint()` function with a valid positive `amount` intended for minting. 
   - Inside the `mint()` function, the adjustment of the collateral amount occurs with the division operation: 
     ```solidity
     amount / (10 ** (boostDecimals - collateralDecimals))
     ```
   - Since `boostDecimals` is less than `collateralDecimals`, this results in an invalid calculation, leading to either a division by zero or an unexpectedly large adjusted amount.
   - The transaction fails, reverting any state changes and potentially preventing the user from successfully minting the intended tokens, causing frustration and distrust in the contract's reliability.


### Impact

Users cannot mint tokens due to the division by zero risk, resulting in lost opportunities and trust in the contract.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

add a check that ensures `boostDecimals` is greater than or equal to `collateralDecimals`.
