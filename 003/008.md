# Minting reverts when collateral has more decimals then BOOST token

### Summary

Because the `Minter::mint` implementation presumes that the BOOST token decimals are always greater or equal than the collateral decimals, minting BOOST tokens when that condition is not true will revert the mint.

### Root Cause


In [Minter.sol:81](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/Minter.sol#L81), the `mint` function attempts to scale the decimals for the collateral to that of the BOOST token when transferring collateral.

```solidity
amount / (10 ** (boostDecimals - collateralDecimals))
```

This operation will revert with an underflow when the decimals of the collateral are higher than those of the BOOST token.

### Internal pre-conditions

The only precondition required is that the `ADMIN_ROLE` calls the `Minter::setTokens` function with a collateral that has `collateralDecimals` greater than `boostDecimals`.


### External pre-conditions

No external pre-conditions.

### Attack Path

`ADMIN_ROLE` calls `Minter::setTokens` with a collateral with higher decimals then BOOST token.
`MINTER_ROLE` cannot call `Minter::mint` as it will now revert.


### Impact

The minter cannot mint tokens in this case

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Scale decimals without any presumptions in the `Minter::mint` function.
