# Excessive Token Minting Risk in MockERC20 Contract

### Summary

The absence of access control on the mint function will allow any user to mint unlimited tokens for themselves, leading to a potential complete loss of value for existing token holders as an attacker could exploit this to generate excessive tokens.

### Root Cause

In MockERC20.sol, there is no restriction on who can call the mint function. This lack of control allows any user to mint tokens at will.

In MockERC20.sol: The mint function is public and can be called by anyone without restrictions.

### Internal pre-conditions

No role needs to be assigned to mint tokens, allowing any address to call the mint function.
The contract can be interacted with by any external user without any checks or balances.


### External pre-conditions

There are no external conditions that limit who can call the mint function, meaning any user can invoke it as long as they have access to the contract.

### Attack Path

An attacker calls the mint() function with their address and a specified amount.
The contract mints the specified amount of tokens to the attacker's address without any checks.
The attacker can repeat this process indefinitely, generating unlimited tokens.


### Impact

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.19;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract MockERC20 is ERC20 {
    uint8 public decimal;

    constructor(string memory _name, string memory _symbol, uint8 _decimals) ERC20(_name, _symbol) {
        decimal = _decimals;
    }

    function decimals() public view virtual override returns (uint8) {
        return decimal;
    }

    function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public {
        _mint(to, amount); // No access control
    }
}


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To mitigate this issue, the mint function should include access control to restrict who can mint new tokens, such as allowing only the contract owner or a designated role to call it. Additionally, emitting events when tokens are minted would improve transparency.
