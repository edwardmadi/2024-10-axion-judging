# Decimal Mismatch in mint Will Cause Reversion on BSC

### Summary

A decimal mismatch in the `mint` function will cause a transaction reversion for users as the protocol will fail to correctly process token minting on chains like Binance Smart Chain (BSC).

### Root Cause

In [`Minter.sol:81`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/Minter.sol#L81) , the expression `amount / (10 ** (boostDecimals - collateralDecimals))` fails when `boostDecimals` is smaller than `collateralDecimals`. Specifically, in scenarios where the collateral token (e.g., USDC on Binance Smart Chain) has 18 decimals, and the boost token has 6 decimals, the subtraction results in a negative exponent `(10 ** (-12))`, which is not allowed in Solidity. This causes incorrect calculations, leading to potential underflows or zero transfer amounts.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to set `boostDecimals` to be exactly `6` (common for stablecoins).
2. Admin needs to set `collateralDecimals` to be exactly `18` (typical for USDC on BSC).
3. User calls the `mint()` function with a valid amount of collateral tokens.


### External pre-conditions

1. The collateral token (USDC) must be deployed on a chain where it uses 18 decimals (e.g., Binance Smart Chain).

### Attack Path

1. Admin deploys the contract on a chain where the collateral token uses 18 decimals.
2. A user calls the `mint()` function with an amount of collateral tokens, expecting a corresponding amount of boost tokens to be minted.
3. The calculation `amount / (10 ** (boostDecimals - collateralDecimals))` causes an overflow/underflow or results in zero, due to the negative exponent from the decimal mismatch.
4. The user either receives an incorrect amount of tokens or the transaction reverts, causing disruptions in the minting process.


### Impact

The users cannot mint tokens or receive an incorrect number of boost tokens, leading to broken functionality for minting stablecoins.
The protocol suffers an approximate loss of functionality due to inability to mint tokens correctly across multiple chains with varying decimal configurations.
