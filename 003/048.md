# `Minter::mint` incorrectly mints 1:1 USD to BOOST

### Summary

Minting `BOOST` tokens via the `Minter::mint` function, incorrectly mints 1:1 USD-pegged-token to `BOOST`, even if the underlying USD to `BOOST` pricing token is different, leading to a potential of funds for the caller.

### Root Cause

The [`Minter::mint` mints](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/Minter.sol#L77-L85) 1:1 USD to `BOOST` to the caller (after equivalent decimal conversion):

```solidity
function mint(address to, uint256 amount) external whenNotPaused onlyContract onlyRole(MINTER_ROLE) {
    IERC20Upgradeable(collateralAddress).safeTransferFrom(
        msg.sender,
        treasury,
        amount / (10 ** (boostDecimals - collateralDecimals))
    );
    IBoostStablecoin(boostAddress).mint(to, amount);
    emit TokenMinted(msg.sender, to, amount);
}
```

In exchange for the 1:1 `BOOST` token, the caller transfers collateral (USD-pegged token) to the protocol treasury.

In essence, the minting behaves like a 1 to 1 swap.

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

The condition for the issue to manifest is that the LP pool swap ratio of `BOOST` to the underlying USD token is not exactly 1-to-1 when a `MINTER_ROLE` holder calls `Minter::mint`.

### Attack Path

An attacker may front-run any `Minter::mint` call with an underlying swap that makes the `BOOST` token less valuable then the paired USD-like token.

This attack does not even require an attacker as it will occur naturally due to price fluctuations.

Example scenario:
- a `USDC-BOOST` Solidly Pool exists with a perfect 1:1 token ratio
- `bob`-the-whale has 100,000 `BOOST` tokens and wants to convert it to `USDC`
- `alice`, a `MINTER_ROLE` holder wants to mint 100,000 `BOOST` tokens for 100,000 `USDC` and calls `Minter::mint`
- `bob` front-runs `alice` with his swap that brings the `BOOST` token value to 0.95 USDC
- `alice`'s minting (swap equivalent) goes through and she paid 100,000 `USDC` to get 100,000 `BOOST` tokens which are worth 95,000 `USDC`, electively losing 5K `USDC`


### Impact

Minter either loses funds, when 1 `BOOST` is less than 1 USD-pegged-token, as he overspends. Or the minter gains more tokens than entitled, if one `BOOST` is more expensive than the paired token.
