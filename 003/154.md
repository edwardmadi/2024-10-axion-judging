# Calculation of collateral amount in `Minter.mint()` function will not be in favor of the protocol.

### Summary

`Minter.mint()` function rounds down the collateral amount which will be transferred from the user to the treasury.

### Root Cause

[Minter.mint()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/Minter.sol#L81)
```solidity
    function mint(address to, uint256 amount) external whenNotPaused onlyContract onlyRole(MINTER_ROLE) {
        IERC20Upgradeable(collateralAddress).safeTransferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            treasury,
            amount / (10 ** (boostDecimals - collateralDecimals))
        );
        IBoostStablecoin(boostAddress).mint(to, amount);
        emit TokenMinted(msg.sender, to, amount);
    }
```
As can be seen, the above function rounds down the collateral amount which will be transferred from the user to the treasury. This is not in favor of the protocol.


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

The collateral has low decimal places.
The lower decimals the collateral has, the larger the loss is. As per readme:
> In the the scope of this audit would be any USD-pegged token, beside fee-on-transfer ones.

For instance, if the collateral is USDC or USDT which has 6 decimals, we have up to `0.000001$` loss because `10 ** (boostDecimals - collateralDecimals) = 10 ** (18 - 6) = 10 ** 12`. If the collateral is GUSD which has 2 decimals, we have up to `0.01$` loss.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Loss of funds. The loss will be larger when the collateral has lower decimals.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To address this issue, the collateral amount in the `Minter.mint()` function should be rounded up instead of down, ensuring that the protocol receives the full intended collateral amount.
