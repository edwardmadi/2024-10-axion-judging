# Approval operation will be reverted if usd token is USDT in Ethereum

### Summary

USDT token in Ethereum is not compatible with the interface IERC20Upgradeable::approve(). This will cause all USDT's approval operation reverted. 

### Root Cause
In [SolidlyV2AMO.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV2AMO.sol#L214), we will try to approve usd for router. However, some usds are not compatible with the interface `IERC20Upgradeable`. This will cause this transaction reverted.
```javascript
IERC20Upgradeable(usd).approve(router, usdAmount);
```

### Internal pre-conditions
In AMO, the usd is USDT, and the AMO is deployed in Ethereum.
In readme.md, our sponsor mentions:
1. The smart contracts can potentially be implemented on any full-EVM chain.
2. In the the scope of this audit would be any USD-pegged token, beside fee-on-transfer ones.
So USDT in Ethereum is in this audit scope.

### External pre-conditions
None

### Attack Path
If AMO is deployed on Ethereum and use USDT as the usd token, `_addLiquidity` function will always be reverted.

### Impact
Some key functions will not work well, for example, `_unfarmBuyBurn`, `_addLiquidity` in SolidlyV2AMO and SolidlyV3AMO.

### PoC
N/A

### Mitigation
Suggest using safeApprove.
