# Incorrect `route` struct usage for velo pools

### Summary

According to the docs at https://sticky-yarrow-52e.notion.site/AXION-Audit-Documentation-11bb3e443073802c949bd3700abad968 and the presence of the `AerodromeUtils.sol` contract, aerodrome/velodrome pools are intended to be supported. However there is a peculiarity in those contracts which can break functionality.

This contract implements the `route` struct similar to how most solidly forks implement it as shown below.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/interfaces/v2/ISolidlyRouter.sol#L5-L9

The issue is that for velodrome and aerodrome, this struct needs an extra `factory` address.

Velodrome on OP: https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xa062aE8A9c5e11aaA026fc2670B0D65cCc8B2858#code
Aerodrome on base: https://basescan.org/address/0xcF77a3Ba9A5CA399B7c97c74d54e5b1Beb874E43#code

```solidity
struct Route {
    address from;
    address to;
    bool stable;
    address factory;
}
```

Due to this difference, the contract wont work with velodrome pools. The devs clearly mentioned that velo support is intended, thus this is an issue.

### Root Cause

The velodrome pools implement the `route` struct differently, with an added `factory` address. This differs from the contracts here, breaking compatibility.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

Broken compatibility with velodrome and aerodrome pools

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

For velodrome/aerodrome interactions, implement a different contract which handles the different router struct.
