# Changing reward vault without claiming rewards is a loss for previous vault

### Summary

The `SolidlyV2AMO` implementation allows the collecting and transfer of reward tokens from the Solidly gauge to a designated reward vault. Changing the reward vault without first claiming existing reward tokens will be a loss for the old vault.

### Root Cause

In case itâ€™s a mistake in the code: In {link to code} the {root cause}

In the `SolidlyV2AMO` contract, retrieving rewards from the Solidly gauge is done by calling the `getReward` function. `getReward` transfers the rewards to the `rewardVault` address at that time.

The `rewardVault` address can be changed via the `setVault` function. However, calling the `setVault` function does not distributes existing, pending rewards up to this point to the [already existing vault](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV2AMO.sol#L104-L108)

```solidity
function setVault(address rewardVault_) public override onlyRole(SETTER_ROLE) {
    if (rewardVault_ == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
    rewardVault = rewardVault_;
    emit VaultSet(rewardVault);
}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

`SETTER_ROLE` calls the `SolidlyV2AMO::setVault` function before the `REWARD_COLLECTOR_ROLE` calls `SolidlyV2AMO::getReward` when there are pending rewards in the gauge.


### External pre-conditions

Pending rewards need to exist in the Solidly Gauge contract that are associated with the `SolidlyV2AMO` contract.

### Attack Path

As the preconditions.

### Impact

Previous reward vault loses any pending rewards. This is a loss of funds.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify the `setVault` to also call `getReward` before-hand.
