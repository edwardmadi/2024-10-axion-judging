# `burn` functions of the `boost` stablecoin left public could lead to a price manipulation and DOS

### Summary

The price of the `boost` token can be manipulated by third party contracts like a `pool` through the burn function 

### Root Cause

Missing control access of the `burn` function for the `boost` token in `BoostStablecoin.sol` that inherits the function from `IERC20Upgradeable`

```solidity
 function burn(uint256 amount) public virtual {
        _burn(_msgSender(), amount);
    }
```
```solidity
 function burnFrom(address account, uint256 amount) public virtual {
        _spendAllowance(account, _msgSender(), amount);
        _burn(account, amount);
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

Users deposit their `boost` tokens in the `pool`.

### External pre-conditions

The `pool` has a function with which can call the `burn` function of the `boost` token. 

### Attack Path

The `pool` calls the `burn` function of the `boost` token to increase the price by burning its own tokens. (the `boost` deposited by the users in the `pool`) 

### Impact

The overall impact is high because of these effects:
- The price can go out of range disabling this way the `addLiquidity` function of the `AMO` contract.
- Users could loose all their `boost` tokens deposited in the `pool`. 
- Decrease in the total supply of the `boost` tokens which can generate many DOS (because potentially the whole supply can go to zero, either by users or other third parties calling the `burn` function and making `MasterAMO` contract unusable).

N.B.  All the aforementioned impacts are not caused because of the `pool` but of the low security level of the `boost` stablecoin that allows the `pool` to manage this way its tokens

### Mitigation

There are several mitigation actions that may be put in place to fix it:
- Make the `burn` function of the `boost` stablecoin `internal` in the `BoostStableCoin.sol` contract
```diff
- function burn(uint256 amount) public virtual {
+ function burn(uint256 amount) internal  {
        _burn(_msgSender(), amount);
    }

-  function burnFrom(address account, uint256 amount) public virtual {
+ function burnFrom(address account, uint256 amount) internal {
        _spendAllowance(account, _msgSender(), amount);
        _burn(account, amount);
    }
```
- Add the onlyRole(AMO_ROLE) modifier to the `burn` functions allowing this way only `AMO` contracts  to call it (allowing it only once checked some parameters like what would be the `total supply` after the `burn` as well as the price in case of  `pools`) 

```diff
- function burn(uint256 amount) public virtual {
+ function burn(uint256 amount) external onlyRole(AMO_ROLE) {
        _burn(_msgSender(), amount);
    }

-  function burnFrom(address account, uint256 amount) public virtual {
+ function burnFrom(address account, uint256 amount) external onlyRole(AMO_ROLE)  {
        _spendAllowance(account, _msgSender(), amount);
        _burn(account, amount);
    }
``` 
- Create a new `ROLE` for the `burn` functions to be granted only to a few verified entities which could in turn make all the checks needed and `burn` tokens on behalf of other third parties like EOAs or other SC that want to `burn` the token
