# Public Burn and BurnFrom Functions in BoostStablecoin Potentially Compromise Supply Equilibrium

### Summary

The `BoostStablecoin` contract allows any user to burn their own tokens or those of another user if they have an allowance, due to the inherited `burn` and `burnFrom` functions from `ERC20BurnableUpgradeable`. This introduces a vulnerability in a stablecoin project that relies on Automated Market Operations roles for controlled `minting` and `burning`. A user could burn tokens directly, impacting the overall supply and breaking the tokenomics that the AMO roles are intended to regulate. This could lead to supply imbalances, destabilizing the peg or requiring extensive corrective actions by the protocol.

### Root Cause

The `BoostStablecoin` contract inherits from [ERC20BurnableUpgradeable](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC20BurnableUpgradeable.sol), which exposes public `burn` and `burnFrom` [functions](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/4f569a4b2a16d7899960ddeb6af643d4564093b8/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC20BurnableUpgradeable.sol#L26-L44). These functions allow any token holder (or a user with an allowance) to burn tokens, bypassing the AMO-regulated burn process and impacting the controlled supply mechanics of the stablecoin.
All the rest of the burning functionalities are with `onlyRole(AMO_ROLE)` modifier, and one public one which is burning a strongly calculated amount of tokens to rebalance the pool.

### Internal pre-conditions

Users can call these burn functions without restriction from the AMO roles, which are intended to manage supply changes.

### External pre-conditions

1. A user has a balance of `BOOST` tokens or an allowance to spend `BOOST` tokens on behalf of another user.
2. The user always has access to the `burn` or `burnFrom` functions to reduce the BOOST token supply.

### Attack Path

1. A user with `BOOST` tokens or an allowance to spend another userâ€™s tokens could call `burn` or `burnFrom` to destroy tokens outside of the AMO-managed supply process.
2. The burn would reduce the overall `BOOST` supply, affecting the tokenomics of the stablecoin.
3. As the BOOST token supply drops, the protocol would need to undertake several corrective measures to bring the system back into equilibrium.

### Impact

Unrestricted burning of `BOOST` tokens could drastically affect the total supply, leading to a loss of the stablecoin's peg and misalignment in liquidity pools.

### Mitigation

Override the inherited `burn` and `burnFrom` functions to ensure that only addresses with the appropriate `AMO` roles can perform these actions. The `burnFrom` can be disabled at all.
