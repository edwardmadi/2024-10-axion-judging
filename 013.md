# Protocol will not work due to hardcoded tokens decimals.

### Summary

In README.md:
> If you are integrating tokens, are you allowing only whitelisted tokens to work with the codebase or any complying with the standard?
> In the the scope of this audit would be any USD-pegged token, beside fee-on-transfer ones.



[BUSD](https://bscscan.com/address/0xe9e7CEA3DedcA5984780Bafc599bD69ADd087D56#readContract) has 18 decimals which can be used as collateral token. There is a wrong internal calculation for tokens minted, causing users to gain more BOOST stable coin by exploiting decimal scaling calculation.

### Root Cause

The admins assumed that all stable pegged tokens are 6 decimals similar to USDC. When `Minter::protocolMint` is called, the implementation tries to subtract BOOST tokens decimal which is 6 with BUSD 18 decimal hence, it breaks core functionality and reverts.
```solidity
// Minter.sol
    function mint(address to, uint256 amount) external whenNotPaused onlyContract onlyRole(MINTER_ROLE) {
        IERC20Upgradeable(collateralAddress).safeTransferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            treasury,
            amount / (10 ** (boostDecimals - collateralDecimals))
        );
        IBoostStablecoin(boostAddress).mint(to, amount);
        emit TokenMinted(msg.sender, to, amount);
    }

```

### Impact

The `Minter::mint` function is crucial to stabilize the stablecoin, it cannot be called, rendering the protocol insolvent.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Ensure that collateral token decimals is scaled correctly:

**To convert valueA to valueB: (18 dp -> 6 dp)
    valueB = valueA / 10**(A.decimals - B.decimals)
    valueB = valueA / (10**(18-6))
