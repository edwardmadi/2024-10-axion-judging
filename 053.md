# Users are not financially incentivized to repeg, so the admin will lose money on calling the repegging functions

### Summary

Users are not financially incentivized to repeg, so the admin will lose money on calling the repegging functions.

### Root Cause

Economically there is no direct incentive to repeg. This will lead to a looser peg and loss of funds for admins as they will have to call the pegging functions more often. 

Only whales with large holdings of boost will be incentivized to repeg when 1 boost < 1 usd, not all users. Small users will not make back the gas fees on the repeg profits. No users are incentivized to repeg when 1 boost > 1 usd, instead they will rather sell or short sell boost. In which case they will take all the profits while the protocol gets nothing, and therefore the protocol will not have usd funds to repeg when 1 boost < 1 usd.

**If the admin does not spend money to call the peg functions, the economic incentives to maintain the peg do not work.**

Checking the code, there is no code to compensate msg.sender for the funds spent on gas.

        // Checks if the actual average price of boost when buying is less than the boostUpperPriceBuy
        if (newBoostPrice > boostUpperPriceBuy) revert PriceNotInRange(newBoostPrice);

### Impact

The peg becomes looser because users are not incentivized to call the peg functions. The admin can repeatedly call the peg functions at a loss if keeping the peg is very important, but then the admin will spend a significant amount of money on gas fees. Incentivizing the users to call the function with protocol funds will prevent this. The total fees spent on gas would be the same, but the admin will save money. Given that admin funds != protocol funds in defi this is a loss of money. This will exceed required 0.01% and 10 USD for medium for chains in README. Base gas fees spiked to 10 gwei before.

Other protocols recognize this as valid issue, see mitigation.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Compensate the users for calling the peg functions. One choice is min(fixed price, X% profit from pegging function).
