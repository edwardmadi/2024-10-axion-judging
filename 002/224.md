# Use of `slot0` to get `_sqrtPriceX96` can lead to price manipulation.

### Summary

the `sqrtPriceX96` is pulled from `Uniswap.slot0`, which is the most recent data point and can be manipulated easily via MEV bots and Flashloans with sandwich attacks; which can cause the loss of funds when interacting with the Uniswap.swap function.

### Root Cause

You can see the `boostPrice` function in SolidlyV3AMO.sol [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV3AMO.sol#L343-L355):
```solidity
function boostPrice() public view override returns (uint256 price) {
        (uint160 _sqrtPriceX96, , , ) = ISolidlyV3Pool(pool).slot0();
        uint256 sqrtPriceX96 = uint256(_sqrtPriceX96);
        if (boost < usd) {
            price = (10 ** (boostDecimals - usdDecimals + PRICE_DECIMALS) * sqrtPriceX96 ** 2) / Q96 ** 2;
        } else {
            if (sqrtPriceX96 >= Q96) {
                price = 10 ** (boostDecimals - usdDecimals + PRICE_DECIMALS) / (sqrtPriceX96 ** 2 / Q96 ** 2);
            } else {
                price = (10 ** (boostDecimals - usdDecimals + PRICE_DECIMALS) * Q96 ** 2) / sqrtPriceX96 ** 2;
            }
        }
 ```
The use of the function `sqrtPriceX96` pulled from Uniswap.slot0. An attacker can simply manipulate the `sqrtPriceX96` and if the `Uniswap.swap` function is called with the `sqrtPriceX96`, the token will be bought at a higher price and the attacker would run the transaction to sell; thereby earning gains but causing a loss of funds to whoever called those functions.

```solidity
    function _unfarmBuyBurn() internal override returns (uint256 liquidity, uint256 newBoostPrice) {
        uint256 totalLiquidity = ISolidlyV3Pool(pool).liquidity();
        uint256 boostBalance = IERC20Upgradeable(boost).balanceOf(pool);
        uint256 usdBalance = toBoostAmount(IERC20Upgradeable(usd).balanceOf(pool)); // scaled
        @>>>>if (boostBalance <= usdBalance) revert PriceNotInRange(boostPrice());

        liquidity = (totalLiquidity * (boostBalance - usdBalance)) / (boostBalance + usdBalance);
        liquidity = (liquidity * LIQUIDITY_COEFF) / FACTOR;

        _unfarmBuyBurn(
            liquidity,
            1, // minBoostRemove
            1, // minUsdRemove
            1, // minBoostAmountOut
            block.timestamp + 1 // deadline
        );

       @>>> newBoostPrice = boostPrice();
    }
    ```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. **User needs to execute a swap transaction** to trigger the `boostPrice` function to fetch the most recent `slot0` value from the Uniswap pool.
2. **Liquidity providers need to manipulate the Uniswap pool** by performing trades or using flash loans to change the `slot0` square root price, causing it to go from a stable price to a manipulated price.
3. **MEV bots need to monitor the mempool** and detect the user’s pending swap transaction to place a front-running transaction that alters the price before the user’s transaction is executed.


### External pre-conditions

1. **The Uniswap pool’s liquidity must be low enough** to allow for significant price fluctuations when trades are executed, making it susceptible to manipulation by MEV bots and flash loans.
2. **The market conditions must enable rapid changes in asset prices**, such as during high volatility periods, allowing the `slot0` value to change significantly within a short timeframe, creating opportunities for front-running or sandwich attacks.

### Attack Path

In the `SolidlyV3AMO` contract, the function `boostPrice` fetches the most recent price data from the Uniswap pool using the `slot0` method. This value, which includes the current square root price, is then used to determine the price of the boost asset relative to the usd asset.

Here’s the relevant code snippet from the boostPrice function:
```solidity
function boostPrice() public view override returns (uint256 price) {
    (uint160 _sqrtPriceX96, , , ) = ISolidlyV3Pool(pool).slot0();
    uint256 sqrtPriceX96 = uint256(_sqrtPriceX96);
    
    if (boost < usd) {
        price = (10 ** (boostDecimals - usdDecimals + PRICE_DECIMALS) * sqrtPriceX96 ** 2) / Q96 ** 2;
    } else {
        if (sqrtPriceX96 >= Q96) {
            price = 10 ** (boostDecimals - usdDecimals + PRICE_DECIMALS) / (sqrtPriceX96 ** 2 / Q96 ** 2);
        } else {
            price = (10 ** (boostDecimals - usdDecimals + PRICE_DECIMALS) * Q96 ** 2) / sqrtPriceX96 ** 2;
        }
    }
}
```
The `boostPrice` function is designed to calculate the price of the boost token based on its ratio to the usd token.
It retrieves the square root price from the Uniswap V3 pool, and depending on the asset relationship, it calculates the price to facilitate trading decisions.



1. Attacker uses a bot to monitor pending transactions in the mempool, looking for a user’s transaction that calls the `_unfarmBuyBurn` function.

2. Upon detecting the user’s transaction, the attacker executes a front-running trade by performing a swap on the Uniswap pool, altering the `slot0` price. This manipulation leads to a significant change in the price of the assets involved.

3 After the attacker’s front-running transaction is confirmed, the user’s transaction calling the `_unfarmBuyBurn` function is executed. This function retrieves the manipulated `boostPrice` from the Uniswap pool, leading to an inaccurate valuation of the assets.

4. The `_unfarmBuyBurn` function assigns the new boost price based on the manipulated price, which underrepresents the actual market value of the assets.

5, As a result of the manipulated price, the user suffers an approximate loss of up to 10% of their invested funds during liquidity removal. The attacker gains this 10% by exploiting the manipulated price to acquire additional tokens at a favorable rate.

6. **Potential Repeated Exploitation:** The attacker can repeat this process for multiple transactions, continuously profiting from users who are unaware of the manipulated market conditions, exacerbating their losses.

### Impact

**Impact:** The users suffer an approximate loss of up to 10% of their invested funds during liquidity removal due to price manipulation in the `_unfarmBuyBurn` function. The attacker gains this 10% by exploiting the manipulated price to acquire additional tokens at a favorable rate, effectively increasing their holdings at the expense of the users' assets.

Impact Example: An attacker could utilize a sandwich attack by placing a buy order just before a large swap is executed, causing the price to spike, then sell immediately afterward to profit from the inflated price. This could lead to the user losing funds due to receiving significantly less value for their tokens in the swap.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use the TWAP function to get the value of `sqrtPriceX96`.
