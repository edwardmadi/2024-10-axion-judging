# `SolidlyV2AMO` does not support USD pegged tokens with less than 6 decimals, such as GUSD

### Summary

Solidity V2 AMO protocol extension contract presumes that all USD pegged tokens have at least 6 decimals. Because of this, calculating the boost price always reverts with tokens that have less than 6 decimals, such as [GUSD](https://etherscan.io/address/0x056fd409e1d7a124bd7017459dfea2f387b6d5cd#readContract#F3) that has 2 decimals.

This oversight undermines the scope of the contract, that declares that any USD-pegged token is to be supported:
> In the the scope of this audit would be any USD-pegged token, beside fee-on-transfer ones.

### Root Cause

In the `SolidlyV2AMO` contract, the `boostPrice` function that calculates the BOOST token price relative to the pegged USD token, the [following decimal scaling reverts](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV2AMO.sol#L392) for USD tokens with less than 6 decimals

```solidity
function boostPrice() public view override returns (uint256 price) {
    uint256 amountOut = IPair(pool).getAmountOut(10 ** boostDecimals, boost);
    price = amountOut / 10 ** (usdDecimals - PRICE_DECIMALS);
}
```

as [`PRICE_DECIMALS` is 6](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/MasterAMO.sol#L89), resulting in an underflow.

Actions that will revert:
- adding [liquidity](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV2AMO.sol#L204)
- mint selling farm action ([1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV2AMO.sol#L355) and [2](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/MasterAMO.sol#L211) )
- unfarm [buy burn action](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV2AMO.sol#L377)



### Internal pre-conditions

A numbered list of conditions to allow the attack path or vulnerability path to happen:

The contract deployer needs to call `SolidlyV2AMO::initialize` with a `usd_` token address that has less than 6 decimals, such as GUSD.

### Impact

Protocol does not function as designed.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Always scale decimals by exactly comparing if they are lower or above the targeted number, do not presume any predefined values.
