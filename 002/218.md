### Summary

### Root Cause

At https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/c65e662999d0c79439703fc6713814b4ad023e01/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV2AMO.sol#L392, it use `usdDecimals - PRICE_DECIMALS` to calc boost price. But It doesn't work with use-pegged token which decimal number is less than 6. 

According to README, it says "USD is a generic name for a reference stable coin paired with BOOST in the AMO ( USDC and USDT are the first natural candidates )".And according to protocol developer, they says "yes potentially we want to pair BOOST with other (partner stables), so if you know any incompatibility with an existing stablecoin ( audited stablecoin, except ofc very weird stuff like stables with tax) this is a valid finding/issue !!!"


GUSD (Gemini Dollar) is a stablecoin issued by the Gemini exchange and backed by the US dollar, complying with regulations set by U.S. financial authorities. The primary purpose of GUSD is to offer a digital asset pegged 1:1 with the US dollar, for users to leverage in the digital economy.The decimal number (precision) of GUSD is 2.
