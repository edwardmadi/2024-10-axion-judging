# Precision Loss due to the direct  division of Sqrtprice by Q96

### Summary

The boost Price is used to compare the price of Boost with the usd token but the direct division of sqrtprice and q96 will introduce a precision loss that directly affects the price returned. 
The issue arises when the Boost token price is compared to the USD token price in the `_unfarmBuyBurn`  functions. This results in inaccurate price calculations, causing a condition that should fail to pass instead. The precision loss can lead to improper price checks and potentially introducing faulty logic into the system.

### Root Cause

The Boost price calculation is performed by dividing `sqrtPriceX96` by `Q96`, which leads to precision loss. The code directly divides the square root price by `Q96`, which causes the computed price to be lower than the actual value. The affected code is as follows:

```solidity
if (sqrtPriceX96 >= Q96) {
    price = 10 ** (boostDecimals - usdDecimals + PRICE_DECIMALS) / (sqrtPriceX96 ** 2 / Q96 ** 2);
}
```

When this precision loss occurs, it results in an inaccurate price being returned and compared to the Boost price range. This can lead to a scenario where the Boost price is incorrectly evaluated as within the allowed range when it should have been out of range.

### Example Scenario:
- The Boost price calculation, when divided directly by `Q96`, results in a lower price than expected due to rounding issues.
- The check `if (newBoostPrice > boostUpperPriceBuy)` fails to revert as intended because the calculated price is inaccurately lower, allowing operations to proceed incorrectly.

### Attack Path

```solidity
if (sqrtPriceX96 >= Q96) {
    price = 10 ** (boostDecimals - usdDecimals + PRICE_DECIMALS) / (sqrtPriceX96 ** 2 / Q96 ** 2);
}
```

basic example- 

10**(6)  divided by  (21**2/20**2) = 10**6 = $1

why

10**(6)  multiplied by 20**2 divided by  (21**2) = 907,029.4 actually price = $0.907

### Impact

The direct consequence of this precision loss is that price checks, which are meant to validate the Boost token price during operations like unfarming , become unreliable.
 This introduces several risks:
- **Faulty price validations**: The system might approve Boost prices that should have been rejected, leading to incorrect  farming.

- **Potential revert**: In scenarios where prices should pass, they might incorrectly fail due to the under-calculated Boost price.

### Mitigation

To mitigate the precision loss, the following code refactor is recommended. The goal is to multiply before dividing to preserve precision and avoid underflows that lead to inaccurate price evaluations. The else code can work for both conditions.
The corrected code snippet:

```solidity
if (sqrtPriceX96 >= Q96) {
    price = (10 ** (boostDecimals - usdDecimals + PRICE_DECIMALS)) * (Q96 ** 2) / (sqrtPriceX96 ** 2);
}
```
