# USD tokens with decimals less than 6 will not work in the protocol

### Summary

Protocol states that "In the the scope of this audit would be any USD-pegged token, beside fee-on-transfer ones". It means it should work with USD tokens that have more or less than 6 deciamls. Due to wrong implementation not all of these tokens will work in the protocol.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/c65e662999d0c79439703fc6713814b4ad023e01/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV2AMO.sol#L390-L393

Every time the `boostPrice` function is called, it reverts due to underflow. In SolidlyV2AMO and SolidlyV3AMO `boostPrice` is called in almost every function.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Token with less than 6 decimals is used in SolidlyV2AMO.
2. Example could be Gemini Dollar which has 2 decimal places. (0x056fd409e1d7a124bd7017459dfea2f387b6d5cd)

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

Protocol will not work with USD tokens that have less than 6 decimal places. It causes DoS for indefinite period of time.

### PoC

To further test this issue you can try to paste this code into remix and pass these parameters as inputs:

`a = 2`

`b = 6`

```javascript
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity 0.8.17;

contract PoC {

    function underflowTest(uint256 a, uint256 b) public pure returns(uint256){
        return a - b;
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

Change `boostPrice` implementation to support tokens with less than 6 decimals or do not support these tokens.
