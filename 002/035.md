# _addLiquidity, mintSellFarm always revert and _unfarmBuyBurn does nothing in V2 AMO if usd decimals too low causing loss of liquidity and peg

### Summary

_addLiquidity, mintSellFarm always revert and _unfarmBuyBurn does nothing in V2 AMO if usd decimals too low causing loss of liquidity and peg.

**The readme states: "In the the scope of this audit would be any USD-pegged token, beside fee-on-transfer ones." Gemini USD has 2 decimals.** https://etherscan.io/token/0x056fd409e1d7a124bd7017459dfea2f387b6d5cd#readContract

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV2AMO.sol#L390-L393

```solidity
    function boostPrice() public view override returns (uint256 price) {
        uint256 amountOut = IPair(pool).getAmountOut(10 ** boostDecimals, boost);
        price = amountOut / 10 ** (usdDecimals - PRICE_DECIMALS);
    }
```

This function will revert if usdDecimals < PRICE_DECIMALS. PRICE_DECIMALS = 6, https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/MasterAMO.sol#L89. 

This will make _addLiquidity always revert as it calls boostPrice. https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV2AMO.sol#L204

This will make the public mintSellFarm always revert as it also calls it. https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/MasterAMO.sol#L211

This will make the public unfarmBuyBurn revert as it requires a positive amount of liquidity and no liquidity can be added. https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV2AMO.sol#L363

This will make the parameterized _unfarmBuyBurn do nothing because the protocol will have no liquidity. https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV2AMO.sol#L300-L307

```solidity
        // Execute the swap and store the amounts of tokens involved
        uint256[] memory amounts = ISolidlyRouter(router).swapExactTokensForTokens(
            usdRemoved,
            minBoostAmountOut,
            routes,
            address(this),
            deadline
        );
```

usdRemoved will always be 0 because the protocol has 0 liquidity and cannot remove any usd:

```solidity
        // Withdraw the specified amount of liquidity tokens from the gauge
        IGauge(gauge).withdraw(liquidity);

        // Approve the transfer of liquidity tokens to the router for removal
        IERC20Upgradeable(pool).approve(router, liquidity);

        uint256 usdBalanceBefore = balanceOfToken(usd);
        // Remove liquidity and store the amounts of USD and BOOST tokens received
        (boostRemoved, usdRemoved) = ISolidlyRouter(router).removeLiquidity(
            boost,
            usd,
            true,
            liquidity,
            minBoostRemove,
            minUsdRemove,
            address(this),
            deadline
        );
```



### Internal pre-conditions

usd decimals < 6

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Not an attack

### Impact

No new liquidity can be added to the token by the AMO. Admin also cannot add liquidity as the parameterized _addLiquidity will always revert. mintSellFarm does not work and users cannot move the peg downwards if the 1 boost >> 1 usd. No one, even admin, can repeg when 1 boost < 1 usd, because _unfarmBuyBurn cannot do anything. The contract is not broken immediately but this may only be noticed after some time has passed when the peg functions actually need to be called. As the peg is lost, this is high.

### PoC

Not required according to the terms. Involves reverting but is not an attack.

### Mitigation

```solidity
price = (amountOut * 10 ** PRICE_DECIMALS) / 10 ** usdDecimals;
```
