# Usage of slot0 is extremely easy to manipulate

### **Summary**
Usage of slot0 is extremely easy to manipulate
### **Vulnerability Details**
The vulnerability lies in the use of the slot0() function from the pool, specifically using its square root price, sqrtPriceX96, directly in the calculation. If the price in the pool's slot0 can be manipulated, an attacker could influence the resulting price in the boostPrice function. 
### **Code Snippet**

BoostPrice function is used in many functions to calculate the newBoostPrice.

### **Impact**
Price Manipulation: Since the slot0() function is integral to the price calculation, any manipulation of this value (e.g., through liquidity manipulation) can directly alter the price returned by boostPrice.
### **Tools Used**
Manual review
### **Recommendation**
Use the TWAP function to get the value of sqrtPriceX96.
