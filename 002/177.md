# Some USD pegged tokens are not supported by the protocol

### Summary

By looking at the [`boostPrice`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV2AMO.sol#L390) function, we see the following block of code:
```javascript
  function boostPrice() public view override returns (uint256 price) {
        uint256 amountOut = IPair(pool).getAmountOut(10 ** boostDecimals, boost);
        price = amountOut / 10 ** (usdDecimals - PRICE_DECIMALS);
    }
```
Taking a look on the last line, we see the problematic `usdDecimals - PRICE_DECIMALS` expression. It is problematic because, as stated in the README.md file:
>
>In the the scope of this audit would be any USD-pegged token, beside fee-on-transfer ones.

This includes low decimals tokens, like [Gemini Usd(GUSD)](https://etherscan.io/token/0x056fd409e1d7a124bd7017459dfea2f387b6d5cd), which has 2 decimals. The problem here is that the expression looks like this when it is calculated: `2-6 = -4`. This will lead to underflow of the `uint` type and the function will revert, leading to permenent incompatibility with such tokens with decimals lower than 6. Considering the statement in the README, this should be considered a valid medium 

### Root Cause

Root cause of the issue, is the poor usage of decimals in the `boostPrice` function, leading to lack of compatibility with weird ERC20 tokens.

### Internal pre-conditions

Usage of token with less than 6 decimals

### External pre-conditions

Tokens has lower than 6 decimals

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

Lack of compatibility with some ERC20, USD pegged tokens 

### PoC

None required for this type of issues 

### Mitigation
