# `boostPrice` in SolidlyV2AMO does not work when `usdDecimals` is less than 6

### Summary

Calculation underflow will cause `boostPrice` reverted if the usd token's decimal is less than 6.

### Root Cause

In [SolidlyV2AMO.sol:392](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV2AMO.sol#L392), the calculation may be reverted if the usd decimal is less than 6.
```solidity
function boostPrice() public view override returns (uint256 price) {
        uint256 amountOut = IPair(pool).getAmountOut(10 ** boostDecimals, boost);
        price = amountOut / 10 ** (usdDecimals - PRICE_DECIMALS);
    }
```
In readme, the sponsor mentions:
1. The smart contracts can potentially be implemented on any full-EVM chain.
2. In the the scope of this audit would be any USD-pegged token, beside fee-on-transfer ones.

In fact, there are some stable coin which decimals are less than 6. For example: GUSD in Ethereum.

### Internal pre-conditions

The AMO is deployed on Ethereum and choose GUSD as the usd token.

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

When we deployed AMO on Ethereum and choose GUSD as the usd token, `boostPrice()` function will keep reverted.``

### Impact

All functions which depends on `boostPrice()` will not work well, for example, `_mintSellFarm`, `_unfarmBuyBurn`, `_addLiquidity`.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

We need to some extra check whether usdDecimals is less than 6.
```diff
        if (usdDecimals < PRICE_DECIMALS)
            price = amountOut * 10** PRICE_DECIMALS/ 10 ** usdDecimals
```
