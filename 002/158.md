# Precision loss

## Summary
Precision loss

## Vulnerability Detail
In Solidity, division should generally be the last operation due to rounding issues. For example, in the line price = 10 ** (boostDecimals - usdDecimals + PRICE_DECIMALS) / (sqrtPriceX96 ** 2 / Q96 ** 2);, the division might lead to precision loss.

## Impact
If there's truncation during division, the result may be significantly less accurate.
