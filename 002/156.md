# Function boostPrice() in SolidlyV2AMO.sol computes unintended results for stablecoins with different decimals

### Summary

Function boostPrice() in SolidlyV2AMO.sol computes unintended results for stablecoins with different decimals, one classic example is the Binance-pegged USDT or USDC which is an 18-decimal stablecoin.

Should an 18-decimal collateral be used in the V2 protocol, unintended computations to the `price` variable used in the `_addLiquidity` function can occur and make the function revert continuously.

In the event that the `boostPrice()` function is triggered, the expected result of the `price` variable which should be around the range of $0.90 to $1.10 (assumed values) per `BOOST` will become $0.000000000001 per `BOOST`.

### Root Cause

The aforementioned findings are located here specifically on L392:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV2AMO.sol#L390-L393

The price computation is dependent on the `amountOut` from the DEX pair contract, and consequently attempts to verify if the amountOut is adjusted for 6 decimals where the unintended results can occur. 

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The `BOOST` token needs to be paired with an 18 decimal token or stablecoin (i.e. BEP-20 USDT, BEP-20 USDC, other 18-decimal stablecoin or token).
2. The off-chain bot starts to trigger functions on the contract.

### External pre-conditions

1. Not applicable

### Attack Path

1. After the initial liquidity input, once the `BOOST` token goes over or under peg, the off-chain bot could trigger a whole lot of functions if the protocol uses the `boostPrice()` function as basis, and render the protocol useless.

### Impact

1. The protocol's internal function `_addLiquidity` will be rendered useless.
2. If the off-chain bot uses the function `boostPrice()` as reference it could malfunction as well.

### PoC

By generating a mock contract that assumes the both `boostDecimals` and `usdDecimals` to be 18, `PRICE_DECIMALS` value to be as is, and a placeholder address for `boost`, we can generate a rough idea on what will happen to the `boostPrice` when we pair the token to a stablecoin with 18 decimals.

        amountOut = amountIn;
    }

    function boostPrice() public view returns (uint256 price, uint256 amountOut) {
        amountOut = getAmountOut(10 ** boostDecimals, boost);
        price = amountOut / 10 ** (usdDecimals - PRICE_DECIMALS); 
    }

}

`price` generated was in 6 decimals, where it should be 18 decimals to accurately compute the price.


### Mitigation

Consider revising the logic of the function `boostPrice()` or explicitly declaring that the V2 protocol is only compatible with 6-decimal stablecoins / token.
