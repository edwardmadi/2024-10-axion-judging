# Reading from pools `slot0` in the `SolidlyV3AMO::boostPrice`

### Summary

The `slot0` struct of a pool is easily manipulatable by a flashloan, which the [`SolidlyV3Pool`](https://ftmscan.com/address/0x54a571D91A5F8beD1D56fC09756F1714F0cd8aD9#code) has as an option. In other words, user can take a flashloan from the pool, changing the price of boost in the `slot0` struct and then normalise it when returning the loan in the same block. This will change the price of the of boost, ultimately DoSing or blocking protocol functionality. 

IMPORTANT:
This can be performed without flashloan, but may require a significant fund usage from the attacker 

### Root Cause

Root cause of the issue is reading from SolidlyV3Pool's `slot0` in the [`SolidlyV3AMO::boostPrice`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV3AMO.sol#L343-L355) contract

### Internal pre-conditions

someone call either `mintSellFarm` or `unfarmBuyBurn` functions

### External pre-conditions

User takes a flashloan from the pool, and changes the price in the `slot0` struct

### Attack Path

Malicious user sees a transaction in the mempool and decides to frontrun it, which is a possible in various L2 chains, which the protocol aims to deploy to. He takes the flashloan to change the the boost token price in the `slot0` struct and then when the price is changed and the transaction that he frontran is already executed, he will return the flashloan in the end of the block

### Impact

This may cause DoS to the following functions: [`unfarmBuyBurn`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/MasterAMO.sol#L296), [`mintSellFarm`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/MasterAMO.sol#L278)
This due to checks performed with the price fetched from `slot0`, which look like this:
`unfarmBuyBurn` function:
```javascript
        if (newBoostPrice > boostUpperPriceBuy) revert PriceNotInRange(newBoostPrice);
```
`mintSellFarm`function:
```javascript
    if (newBoostPrice < boostLowerPriceSell) revert PriceNotInRange(newBoostPrice);
```
Functions, which functionality will be blocked: [`_mintSellFarm`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/MasterAMO.sol#L199-L216)
The `addLiquidity` functionality of the function will be blocked becaus eof the following check:
```javascript
uint256 price = boostPrice();
        if (price > FACTOR - validRangeWidth && price < FACTOR + validRangeWidth) {
```
