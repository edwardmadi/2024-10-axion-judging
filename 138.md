# Missing Deadline Enforcement in mintAndSellBoost

### Summary

The mintAndSellBoost function is intended to sell a specified amount of Boost for USD, while respecting a specified deadline. However, the function does not currently enforce the deadline, leading to potential risks where the transaction could be executed at an unintended or unfavorable time.

### Root Cause

The deadline parameter is crucial in DeFi functions that involve market-sensitive transactions. It ensures that the transaction is executed within a certain time window to prevent it from being executed in outdated market conditions.

In the current implementation, the mintAndSellBoost function lacks a check to enforce the deadline. Without this check, it is possible for the transaction to be executed long after it was intended, which could lead to unfavorable price conditions or even manipulation.

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Without this check, the function could be called long after the intended execution time, exposing the protocol to:

Market risk: If the Boost price changes drastically after the transaction is submitted but before it is executed, the protocol could suffer a financial loss.
Arbitrage/exploitation: Bad actors could exploit the lack of deadline enforcement to execute transactions in a way that benefits them and harms the protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Ensure that _mintAndSellBoost or the mintAndSellBoost function itself checks the deadline and reverts if the transaction is executed after this time.
A simple check should be added to ensure that the current block timestamp does not exceed the deadline parameter:
`if (block.timestamp > deadline) revert TransactionExpired();
`
