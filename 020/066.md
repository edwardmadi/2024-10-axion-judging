# _addLiquidity() will be blocked if the gauge is inactive in Aerodrome

### Summary

The gauge's missing check may block _addLiquidity() function in SolidlyV2AMO if the gauge is inactive in Aerodrome.

### Root Cause

In [SolidlyV2AMO.sol:243](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV2AMO.sol#L240-L244), we will deposit LP into the gauge.
But this operation will not always succeed. 
In Aerodrome, users can deposit for one gauge on condition that the gauge is alive. Any gauge may be not alive, this may be triggered by Voter contract.
```solidity
    function _depositFor(uint256 _amount, address _recipient) internal nonReentrant {
        if (_amount == 0) revert ZeroAmount();
        if (!IVoter(voter).isAlive(address(this))) revert NotAlive();

        address sender = _msgSender();
        _updateRewards(_recipient);

        IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransferFrom(sender, address(this), _amount);
        totalSupply += _amount;
        balanceOf[_recipient] += _amount;

        emit Deposit(sender, _recipient, _amount);
    }

```
### Internal pre-conditions
SolidlyV2AMO connect with Aerodrome.

### External pre-conditions
This gauge in Aerodrome is killed in `Voter`.

### Attack Path
- One AMO is deployed with one Aerodrome pool.
- One day, the gauge for this pool is killed and the gauge becomes inactive.
- `_addLiquidity` will always be reverted.

### Impact
`mintSellFarm` function will always be reverted because we cannot add liquidity. This will cause we cannot process the boost overpeg condition.

### PoC
NA

### Mitigation
Check whether the gauge is alive. If the related pool's gauge is inactive, we should not deposit gauge.
