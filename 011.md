# Missing validation can lead to Minter contract minting different boost tokens

### Summary

There is no validation check that  the **minter** contract set in the `MasterAMO.sol` `initialize()` method has same **boost** token address or not. There is no way to update **boost** address later because of the missing setter function.

### Root Cause

There is missing validation in `initialize()` that the underlying boost token of Minter contract should be same as boost token of MasterAMO contract.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Both method `_mintAndSellBoost()` and `_addLiquidity()` will revert because of insufficient boost tokens minted.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a check to verify as below in `initialize()`:
```solidity
if(!(IMinter(boostMinter_).boostAddress() == boost_)) {
    revert INVALID_MINTER_ADDRESS();
}
```
