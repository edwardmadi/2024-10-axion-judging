# Boost can be sold under peg despite comments and code attempting to prevent it

### Summary

Boost can be sold under peg despite comments and code attempting to prevent it. This is defined in the comments https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/MasterAMO.sol#L148-L150 and readme " There are, however, some hard-coded limitations —— mainly to ensure that **even admins can only** buyback BOOST below peg and **sell it above peg**. These are doctsringed."

### Root Cause

The only apparent check to prevent boost from being sold below peg is a simple if statement:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV2AMO.sol#L171

```solidity
        if (minUsdAmountOut < toUsdAmount(boostAmount)) minUsdAmountOut = toUsdAmount(boostAmount);
```

However this does not prevent boost from being sold below peg. Consider pool with 90 boost and 110 usdc (ignore fees for now). 1 boost > 1 usdc. If _mintAndSellBoost is called with 20 boost, we will get end result 110 boost and 90 usdc. 20 boost were sold for 20 usdc. However, some of the boost were sold below the peg. Consider the first boost we sold. It was above the peg. At about 99.498 boost and 99.498 usdc the pool will be balanced. However, once we continue selling boost we will be selling below the peg.

The admin can call mintAndSellBoost directly. https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/MasterAMO.sol#L155-L168

The following affiliated check does nothing as without fee on transfer it will always pass. https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV2AMO.sol#L186-L188

```solidity
        // we check that selling BOOST yields proportionally more USD
        if (usdAmountOut != usdBalanceAfter - usdBalanceBefore)
            revert UsdAmountOutMismatch(usdAmountOut, usdBalanceAfter - usdBalanceBefore);
```

This also applies to mintSellFarm as it does the same call with toUsdAmount(boostAmount) https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV2AMO.sol#L349.

This may not apply to V3 AMO depending on if targetSqrtPriceX96 is set correctly: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV3AMO.sol#L141-L160

This contradicts the comments and readme stating that boost cannot be sold below peg by the AMO. 

### Internal pre-conditions

no preconditions

### External pre-conditions

no preconditions

### Attack Path

Not an attack

### Impact

The protocol loses funds equivalent to the area under the curve of boost sold below peg. In large depeg this could be a huge amount of money. In the 90 - 110 example the total loss is 10.502 - 9.498 = 1.004. The protocol has lost 5% of the funds used in _mintAndSellBoost. High severity as it has large loss and violates important invariant specified explicitly in readme.

### PoC

Not required according to the terms

### Mitigation

Check that you can only sell to the sqrt K 1:1 balanced price.
