# Stablecoin system extremely susceptible to depegs of underlying tokens

### Summary

The boost stablecoin system mints tokens 1:1 as shown in the `mint` function in the minter contract.

Furthermore, when minting boost tokens for providing liquidity, they are again minted 1:! with the collateral, and liquidity is provided at around the 1:1 price wrt to the collateral.

So if boost is being minted against usdc, the contract also mints boost and provides liquidity at a boost-usdc price of 1. However if usdc itself depegs to 0.98 (say), then the protocol will be minting and providing liquidity at a boost-usdc price of 1, but a boost-usd price of 0.98, since usdc is not pegged to usd anymore. So the protocol will even deepen the depeg, by creating and adding more liquidity at this depegged price.

So the boost token is not pegged to the price of usd, but to the price of the collateral. If multiple different tokens are used as collateral, then the boost token will depeg if any single one of the collateral tokens depeg.

Similar systems, like DAI, liquidity LUSD etc use an oracle and overcollateralization to prevent this scenario. This way, the true market value of USDC is used, instead of assuming it to be 1 USD, and there exists a leeway due to the overcollateralization which prevents the immediate depeg of the stablecoin.

### Root Cause

The main reason for this is that boost tokens are always minted 1:1 with the collateral tokens. This means its true peg is to the collateral token, not 1 USD.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

Depeg of any collateral assets

### Attack Path

Any depeg of collateral tokens will immediately depeg the stablecoin.

### Impact

Boost token will depeg and the protocol will continue adding liquidity to V2 and V3 pools at depegged prices.

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

Consider adding an oracle, so that the true value of collateral is used when adding liquidity, and not just add liquidity at 1:1 ratio with the collateral.
