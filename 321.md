# Casting Overflow will Cause Incorrect `liquidity` Operations

### Summary

Casting `liquidity` from `uint256` to `uint128` will cause incorrect liquidity operations for contract users as the contract may overflow the liquidity value during both minting and removal processes.

### Root Cause

In both the `ISolidlyV3Pool(pool).mint` and `ISolidlyV3Pool(pool).burnAndCollect` function calls in contract `SolidlyV3AMO`, the casting of liquidity from `uint256` to `uint128` can lead to overflow if the value exceeds `uint128`'s maximum limit.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The `liquidity` parameter is set to a value greater than type(uint128).max.
2. The contract lacks validation to ensure `liquidity` is within the `uint128` range before casting.

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. A function that includes either the `mint` or `burnAndCollec`t operation is called with an excessively large `liquidity` value.
2. The `liquidity` value is cast to `uint128`, resulting in overflow and a smaller, incorrect value being used in the operation process.


### Impact

The contract users suffer an approximate loss of liquidity accuracy. The intended liquidity is not correctly added to or removed from the pool, potentially leading to financial discrepancies and reduced functionality.

### PoC


### Mitigation

Implement a validation check before casting to ensure liquidity does not exceed uint128's maximum value. Use a statement like
```solidity
require(liquidity <= type(uint128).max, "Liquidity exceeds uint128 max");
```
 to prevent overflow.
