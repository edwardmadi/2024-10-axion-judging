# `MasterAMO` wil not be upgradable.

### Summary

The `MasterAMO` contract has no gap storage. Therefore it will not be upgradable.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/MasterAMO.sol#L22

```solidity
/**
 * the contracts are upgradable but behind a time lock. This is because we plan further improvements to the AMO logic ( we could for instance deploy an AMO cotract for concentrated liquidity).
 * in future versions, upgrades could be strictly tied to a governance vote (where upgrade can only be passed with testified governance vote approval)
 * the contracts are pausable â€” also governance-unpausable to ensure decentralisation
 */

abstract contract MasterAMO is
    IMasterAMO,
    Initializable,
    AccessControlEnumerableUpgradeable,
    PausableUpgradeable,
    ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable

From the comment, we can see the `MasterAMO` contract should be upgradable. However it has no storage gap variable. Furthermore, it is the base contract of `SolidlyV2AMO` and `SolidlyV3AMO`. Therefore, any change of the layout of storage variables of `MasterAMO` contract will break the one of `SolidlyV2AMO` and `SolidlyV3AMO` contracts.


### Internal pre-conditions

Nothing.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Nothing.

### Impact

Break the upgradability of the contract. The same problem exists in `MasterUtils` contract.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add storage gap variable to the `MasterAMO` and `MasterUtils` contract.
