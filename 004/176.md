# Corruptible Upgradability Pattern

### Summary

AMO contracts (`SolidlyV2AMO`, `SolidlyV3AMO`) contracts might be corrupted during an upgrade due to missing gaps for storage slots in their parent contract `MasterAMO`.

### Root Cause

The two contracts `SolidlyV2AMO`, `SolidlyV3AMO` inherit `MasterAMO`. All AMO contracts are upgradeable by default.

The issue is, the `MasterAMO` contract and `SolidlyV2AMO`, `SolidlyV3AMO` contracts contain a lot of storage variables. But there is no gap storage implemented in `MasterAMO`.

Without gaps, adding new storage variables to any of these contracts can potentially overwrite the beginning of the storage layout of the child contract, causing critical misbehaviors in the system.

- SolidlyV2AMO: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV2AMO.sol#L10
- SolidlyV3AMO: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV3AMO.sol#L8

Note that in solidly-utils, the MasterUtils contract is inherited by a lot of contracts, and it also doesn't have a gap. However, the child contracts currently don't have any storage variables, so this is not an issue for now, but also good to fix.
