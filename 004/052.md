# Missing Storage Gap in Upgradeable Contract

### Summary

The absence of a storage gap variable will cause a potential storage collision for future upgrades as new variables added to inherited contracts will shift storage slots, potentially breaking the contract's functionality.

### Root Cause

 In `MasterUtils.sol`,  `MasterAmo.sol`,  `Minter.sol`, `BoostStablecoin.sol`  the contract is designed to be upgradeable but lacks a storage gap variable, which is crucial for safely adding new state variables in future upgrades.

### Internal pre-conditions

Owner decide to upgrade the contract 

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

Attack Path:
1. The contract owner decides to upgrade the  contract.
2. New state variables are added to the contract or its inherited contracts.
3. The upgrade is deployed, causing all subsequent variables' storage slots to shift.
4. Existing functions that rely on the original storage layout now access incorrect data.

### Impact

The contract becomes dysfunctional after an upgrade, potentially leading to loss of funds or critical functionality for all users interacting with the contract.

### Mitigation
in https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/d75df3636ea28dd627d548d5d473c5d5477b0dc6/solidly-utils/contracts/MasterUtils.sol#L12
Add a storage gap variable to the contract:
```solidity
contract MasterUtils is AccessControlEnumerableUpgradeable, ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable {
    // ... existing code ...

    uint256[50] private __gap;
}
```
