# Missing` _gap` in `MasterAMO` can cause potential corrupted storage when upgrading

### Summary

The abstract contract `MasterAMO` works as the base of `SolidlyV2AMO` and `SolidlyV3AMO`, and with all three contracts being upgradeable, there is an absense of `_gap` can cause storage corruption issues when doing upgrades.

### Root Cause

[`MasterAMO`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/MasterAMO.sol#L22) is an upgradeable abstract contract, but missing `_gap` for reserved storage variables:

```solidity
abstract contract MasterAMO is
    IMasterAMO,
    Initializable,
    AccessControlEnumerableUpgradeable,
    PausableUpgradeable,
    ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable
{
```

When upgrades are conducted, it can cause potential storage corruption due to collision.
