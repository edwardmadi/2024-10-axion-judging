# Missing storage gap in upgradeable contracts

### Summary

When designing an upgradeable smart contract using proxies, the storage layout must remain consistent across all contract versions. If additional storage variables are added in future contract versions without reserved space, it can lead to storage collisions with existing variables, potentially leading to critical issues such as data corruption or loss.
