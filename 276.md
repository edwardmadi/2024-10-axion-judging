# Pause and unpause are not applied in the protocol's checks

### Summary



In the `BoostStablecoin` contract, there are `pause()` and `unpause()` functions, which indicate that the protocol has the ability to pause operations. 
```solidity
   function pause() public onlyRole(PAUSER_ROLE) {
        _pause();
    }

    function unpause() public onlyRole(UNPAUSER_ROLE) {
        _unpause();
    }

```


However, these functions are not applied in any checks within other functions, meaning the paused state is not being verified.

```solidity
   function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public onlyRole(MINTER_ROLE) {
        _mint(to, amount);
    }

```

### Root Cause

pause and unpause are not applied in the protocol's checks.



### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

The PAUSER_ROLE has paused the protocol, but the MINTER_ROLE can still mint tokens.


### Impact

The protocol's governance is ineffective.



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add protocol state checks to the corresponding functions.
