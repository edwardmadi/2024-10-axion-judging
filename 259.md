# protocol assumes all usd pegged tokens have 6 decimals

### Summary

the protocol is designed to work with all usd pegged tokens however it assumes that all the tokens have 6 decimals which is not the case

here are some usd pegged tokens with more than 6 decimals 

 Dai (DAI): 18 decimals
TrueUSD (TUSD): 18 decimals
Pax Dollar (PAX): 18 decimals
sUSD (sUSD): 18 decimals
mStable USD (mUSD): 18 decimals
Neutrino USD (USDN): 18 decimals

this can lead to issues for the protocol as a result the protocol is not compliant with any usd pegged tokens with more than 6 decimal
