# Unbounded Loop with External Calls in `SolidlyV2AMO.sol::getReward`

### Summary

The unbounded loop with external calls in the getReward function may lead to gas limit issues and failed transactions as the number of reward tokens increases.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/c65e662999d0c79439703fc6713814b4ad023e01/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV2AMO.sol#L332C7-L336C10

### Root Cause

In `SolidlyV2AMO.sol`, the `getReward` function contains an unbounded loop that makes `external calls` for each token in the provided array, without considering `potential gas limit` constraints as the protocol scales.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The number of whitelisted reward tokens has increased significantly over time.  
2. The REWARD_COLLECTOR_ROLE aims to collect rewards for all tokens in one transaction.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The protocol collects a variety of approved reward tokens over time.  
2. The REWARD_COLLECTOR_ROLE starts a transaction to gather rewards for all these tokens.  
3. The transaction handles each token one by one, checking balances and transferring them externally.  
4. As the number of tokens increases, gas usage rises in a linear fashion.  
5. At some point, the transaction might fail.  
6. This reduces the efficiency of the REWARD_COLLECTOR_ROLE in gathering rewards, resulting in unclaimed rewards and disrupting the protocolâ€™s distribution system.

### Impact

The protocol's reward collection mechanism may become inefficient or inoperable as the number of reward tokens increases

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a method to separate token withdrawals to receive rewards for each token in a transaction.
