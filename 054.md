# Immutable Role Assignment in Upgradeable Contracts in `MasterUtils.sol`

### Summary

The fixed role assignment at contract initialization poses a security risk, as compromised admin accounts cannot be revoked or replaced, potentially allowing unauthorized control over essential contract functions.

### Root Cause

 In MasterUtils.sol, the initialize function sets up roles using _setupRole without providing mechanisms to change or revoke these roles. 

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The contract needs to be deployed and initialized.
2. Roles (DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, OPERATOR_ROLE, SETTER_ROLE, WITHDRAWER_ROLE) are assigned to specific addresses during initialization.

### External pre-conditions

A role address get hacked.

### Attack Path

1. An attacker gains control of a critical address (e.g.,  OPERATOR_ROLE).  
2. They can perform unauthorized actions, like  altering essential parameters.  
3. The protocol owners are unable to revoke the compromised role or assign it to a secure address.

### Impact

The protocol risks losing control over essential functions, which may result in financial losses, unauthorized alterations to contract parameters, or complete contract failure, impacting all users and stakeholders.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement functions to revoke and reassign roles, accessible only by the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE or the WITHDRAWER_ROLE because its a multisig
