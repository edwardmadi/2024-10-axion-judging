# Gauge's withdrawal may be blocked if the gauge in THENA is in emergency

### Summary

The missing check in [SolidlyV2AMO:264](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV2AMO.sol#L264) will cause the gauge's withdrawal reverted.

### Root Cause

In THENA, the gauge has one emergency mode. If the owner active this gauge's emergency mode, the withdraw will not work. Depositors need to withdraw their funds via `emergencyWithdraw`.
If this AMO's related gauge is in emergency mode, the gauge's withdraw() will keep reverted.
```solidity
    function activateEmergencyMode() external onlyOwner {
        require(emergency == false, "emergency");
@>        emergency = true;
        emit EmergencyActivated(address(this), block.timestamp);
    }
@>    function _withdraw(uint256 amount) internal nonReentrant isNotEmergency updateReward(msg.sender) {
    }
    function emergencyWithdraw() external nonReentrant {
        require(emergency, "emergency");
        require(_balances[msg.sender] > 0, "no balances");
        uint256 _amount = _balances[msg.sender];
        _totalSupply = _totalSupply - _amount;
        _balances[msg.sender] = 0;
        TOKEN.safeTransfer(msg.sender, _amount);
        emit Withdraw(msg.sender, _amount);
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

This SolidlyV2AMO contract will connect with THENA. And this SolidlyV2AMO's gauge is one THENA gauge.

### External pre-conditions

The THENA gauge is in emergency mode by the THENA gauge's owner.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

- When the related gauge's in emergency mode, the `_unfarmBuyBurn` will always be reverted because we fail to withdraw from gauge. This will cause we cannot process the boost below-pegged case.
- Our deposited LPs are stuck in gauge. This may bring more risk. 

### PoC
N/A

### Mitigation

Need to be compatible with THENA's emergency mode. If this gauge is in emergency mode, we can withdraw our LP tokens via emergencywithdraw.
