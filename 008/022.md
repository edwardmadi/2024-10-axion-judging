# Did not approve to zero

### Summary
In the `SolidlyV2AMO` contract, the allowance was not set to zero in the `_unfarmBuyBurn` function.

### Root Cause
According to the README, it is stated that...
> In the the scope of this audit would be any USD-pegged token, beside fee-on-transfer ones.

But the  `_unfarmBuyBurn` function does not approve zero first or in the last , but uses `approve` method.
```solidity
IERC20Upgradeable(usd).approve(router, usdRemoved);
```


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

Some ERC20 tokens (like USDT) do not work when changing the allowance from an existing non-zero allowance value. For example Tether (USDT)'s approve() function will revert if the current approval is not zero.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The `_unfarmBuyBurn` function will be reverted.

### Mitigation
 Revoke the approval in the `_unfarmBuyBurn` function.
```solidity
IERC20Upgradeable(usd).approve(pool, 0);
```
