# liquidity amount depends on the pool's balance which can be manipulated

### Summary

To add liquidity to the pool, an address with the `AMO_ROLE` granted can call the  [addLiquidity()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/MasterAMO.sol#L178 )  function which relies on `_addLiquidity]( )`  . However, the function relies on the current USD balance in the pool, which  can be easily manipulated.  

### Root Cause

In the [_addLiquidity](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV3AMO.sol#L168 ) function , the amount of boost to mint based on the `usdAmount` and `boostMultiplier` is given by `uint256 boostAmount = (toBoostAmount(usdAmount) * boostMultiplier) / FACTOR;` .  The  `usdAmount` is user supplied . 

The `SolidlyV3AMO` contract approves the  liquidity pool of values   `boostAmount` and `usdAmount` to allow the  transfer of  the specified amount of tokens from the contract.


Before the  amount of liquidity is minted from the pool to the `SolidlyV3AMO` contract  , liquidity is given by `liquidity =  liquidity = (usdAmount * currentLiquidity) / IERC20Upgradeable(usd).balanceOf(pool);`



The issue here is that if the `IERC20Upgradeable(usd).balanceOf(pool)`  changes, it can lead to either more or less  of liquidity amount. Since this balance serves as the denominator in the liquidity calculation, any changes to it can significantly affect how much liquidity  is  received.
  

### Internal pre-conditions

Lets consider the following scenario based on `liquidity = (usdAmount * currentLiquidity) / IERC20Upgradeable(usd).balanceOf(pool)`

Note that the contract is only approving `boostAmount` and `usdAmount` to be transferred  out 

Assuming under normal circumstance :
`usdAmount` = 1000
`currentLiquidity` = 50000
`IERC20Upgradeable(usd).balanceOf(pool)` = 1000

The liquidity calculation would be:

`usdAmount` x `currentLiquidity` / `IERC20Upgradeable(usd).balanceOf(pool)`

 `(1000 x 50000)/ 1000`  and the contract will  receive 50,000 liquidity units.


An attacker perfroms a swap to increase  the balance to 
IERC20Upgradeable(usd).balanceOf(pool) = 10000

 `(1000 x 50000)/ 10000`  and the contract will  receive 25,000 liquidity units for the same amount approved initially

Protocol losses 25,000.
