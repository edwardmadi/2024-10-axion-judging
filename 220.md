# Hardcoded slippage and lack of deadline allow pool manipulation and miner exploitation.

### Summary

The hardcoded slippage values (minBoostSpend and minUsdSpend set to 1) will cause users to receive unfavorable LP amounts due to potential pool manipulation. Additionally, the absence of an effective deadline allows miners to hold transactions in the mempool and execute them at an opportunistic moment, further increasing the likelihood of users receiving poor outcomes.

### Root Cause

- In [solidityV2AMO](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/c65e662999d0c79439703fc6713814b4ad023e01/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV2AMO.sol#L342C5-L356C6 )the slippage values (minBoostSpend and minUsdSpend) are hardcoded to a very low amount (1), providing minimal tolerance for price fluctuations during liquidity addition.
- The use of block.timestamp as a deadline without a buffer allows miners to hold transactions in the mempool, waiting for favorable conditions to arise, such as changes in pool pricing.

### Attack Path

- A user initiates a liquidity addition via the _addLiquidity() function with hardcoded slippage values.
- A miner or attacker monitors the pending transaction and holds it in the mempool, waiting for the price of BOOST to change in their favor.
- During this time, pool manipulators (or natural price volatility) cause the BOOST price to deviate, making the user receive less LP tokens than expected.
- The miner eventually executes the transaction when the pool conditions are most unfavorable to the user, resulting in poor LP returns.

### Impact

- User Impact: Users receive unfavorable LP amounts due to price changes during transaction delays, leading to potential losses.
- Miner/Attacker Gain: Miners or attackers profit by executing transactions at a point where pool manipulation or price shifts work against the user, allowing arbitrage or front-running opportunities
