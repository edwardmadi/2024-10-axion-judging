# non of the contracts are ERC1504 compliant

### Summary

none of the contracts are ERC1504 compliant

### Root Cause

None of the contracts inherit and use Handler interface and Data contract 

```solidity
/// Handler interface.
/// Handler defines business related functions.
/// Use the interface to ensure that your external services are always supported.
/// Because of function live(), we design IHandler as an abstract contract rather than a true interface.
contract IHandler {

    /// Initialize the data contarct.
    /// @param  _str    value of exmStr of Data contract.
    /// @param  _int    value of exmInt of Data contract.
    /// @param  _array  value of exmArray of Data contract.
    function initialize (string _str, uint256 _int, uint16 [] _array) public;

    /// Register Upgrader contract address.
    /// @param  _upgraderAddr   address of the Upgrader contract.
    function registerUpgrader (address _upgraderAddr) external;

    /// Upgrader contract calls this to check if it is registered.
    /// @return if the Upgrader contract is registered.
    function isUpgraderRegistered () external view returns(bool);

    /// Handler has been upgraded so the original one has to self-destruct.
    function done() external;

    /// Check if the Handler contract is a working Handler contract.
    /// It is used to prove the contract is a Handler contract.
    /// @return always true.
    function live() external pure returns(bool) {
        return true;
    }

    /** Functions - define functions here */

    /** Events - add events here */
