# Double Minting of Boost Tokens in mintSellFarm() Function locks the BOOST token in the contract

### Summary

The mintSellFarm() function in the MasterAMO.sol contract, which calls _mintSellFarm in SolidlyV3AMO.sol, inadvertently results in double-minting of Boost tokens. The expected behavior of the _mintSellFarm function is to sell the existing Boost tokens present in the contract. However, due to a design flaw, _mintSellFarm mints additional Boost tokens before selling them.

### Root Cause

The root cause is the structure of the mintSellFarm function, which indirectly calls _mintAndSellBoost() inside SolidlyV3AMO.sol. Instead of using the existing Boost tokens in the contract, this function inadvertently mints new tokens and sells them, causing an unexpected increase in Boost token supply.

### Attack Path

1. A user calls the mintSellFarm() function.
2. mintSellFarm() calls _mintSellFarm(), which is expected to use the existing Boost tokens.
3. MasterAMO::_mintSellFarm() instead calls SolidlyV3AMO::_mintAndSellBoost(), which mints new Boost tokens rather than using the existing ones.
4. The protocol sells the newly minted Boost tokens in the pool, resulting in an increase in total Boost supply and those tokens will be locked in the contract. 

### Impact

BOOST tokens present in the contract cannot be sell and will be locked in the contract.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Create a separate function which utilizes the BOOST tokens present in the contract instead of minting the new one.
