# Incorrect deadline in `SolidlyV2AMO` and `SolidlyV3AMO`

### Summary

`Block.timestamp + 1` is being used instead of using `block.number + 1` causing the deadline to be wrong and offering no real protection

### Root Cause

The use of `block.timestamp + 1` as the deadline in multiple places of the code

### Internal pre-conditions

none

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

check out [SolidlyV2AMO:352](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV2AMO.sol#L352), [SolidlyV3AMO:313](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV3AMO.sol#L313) and [SolidlyV3AMO:333](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV3AMO.sol#L333)

### Impact

There is no real deadline and the comment shows that it was a wrong deadline added and not the intended

### PoC

In the code snippet below we can see the deadline is `block.timestamp + 1` which is not effective but in the comments the protocol intends to set it to the next block which is also not the right implementation

```solidity
function _unfarmBuyBurn() internal override returns (uint256 liquidity, uint256 newBoostPrice) {
        (uint256 boostReserve, uint256 usdReserve) = getReserves();

...
        _unfarmBuyBurn(
            liquidity,
            (liquidity * boostReserve) / totalLp, // the minBoostRemove argument
            toUsdAmount(usdNeeded), // the minUsdRemove argument
            usdNeeded, // the minBoostAmountOut argument
>>            block.timestamp + 1 // deadline is next block as the computation is valid instantly | @audit-note if it should be next block it should be blocknumber + 1 rather 
        );
```
this style of deadline has been used in multiple places but this is just an example since it is the same implementation

### Mitigation

Taking into consideration the comment `deadline is next block as the computation is valid instantly ` this means `block.timestamp + 1` is wrong  and must be changed to `block.number + 1` because this is the intended deadline.

other parts of the protocol implemented the same line so i think it should be changed [line 352](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV2AMO.sol#L352), [SolidlyV3AMO:313](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV3AMO.sol#L313) and [SolidlyV3AMO:333](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV3AMO.sol#L333)
