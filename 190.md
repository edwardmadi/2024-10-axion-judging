# Liquidity Provider will fail to execute liquidity addition operation if USD balance is insufficient

### Summary

The missing check in contracts/MasterAMO.sol will cause a failed liquidity addition operation for liquidity providers as the contract will attempt to approve and transfer more USD than available

### Root Cause

In contracts/MasterAMO.sol:178 there is a missing check on the USD balance to ensure the contract holds enough USD before attempting to approve or transfer the specified amount. This lack of validation could result in failed liquidity addition operations, as the contract may try to execute transfers or approvals for an amount that exceeds the available balance, causing the transaction to revert unexpectedly.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. AMO role needs to call `addLiquidity()` with `usdAmount` set to any value greater than the current USD balance in the contract.
2. The `usdAmount` passed to `addLiquidity()` needs to be greater than `minUsdSpend`.
3. The contract has not yet checked the balance of USD tokens before approving or transferring them.

### External pre-conditions

1. The contract needs to interact with an external liquidity pool through a router.
2. The external router contract should not impose any additional checks on the transferred amounts before executing the liquidity addition.
3. The USD token contract does not revert on insufficient balance during the `approve()` or `transfer()` process and only fails during the actual liquidity addition.

### Attack Path

1. The AMO role calls `addLiquidity()` function, passing in a `usdAmount` greater than the contract's current USD balance.
2. The contract attempts to call `_addLiquidity()` where it approves and attempts to transfer more USD tokens than available in the contract.
3. The liquidity addition process fails or reverts during the external contract interaction due to insufficient funds, causing the entire transaction to revert.

### Impact

In case it’s an attack path: The **protocol** suffers an approximate loss of **potential operational inefficiency** as the **transaction fails** due to insufficient USD balance. **Liquidity providers** lose time and incur potential **gas fees** from reverted transactions. The attacker **doesn't gain** anything directly but can potentially **disrupt the liquidity operations**.

Example:

- **Liquidity providers** incur gas costs for every failed transaction due to insufficient USD balance. No liquidity is added, and the attacker may repeatedly trigger the issue to **cause disruptions** without gaining financially.

In case it’s a vulnerability path: The **protocol** suffers **transaction failures** due to improper balance checks, and **liquidity providers** cannot add liquidity if the USD balance is insufficient.

Example:

- **Liquidity providers** face a continuous issue where transactions revert due to insufficient balance, **preventing liquidity addition** in the pool.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To mitigate the issue of insufficient USD balance leading to failed liquidity addition:

**Pre-check the contract's USD balance**: Before approving or attempting to transfer USD tokens, the contract should explicitly check whether it holds enough USD to cover the specified `usdAmount`. This can be done by using the `balanceOf` function to compare the contract's balance with the required amount. If the balance is insufficient, the function should revert with a clear error message.

   Example:
   ```solidity
   uint256 currentUsdBalance = IERC20Upgradeable(usd).balanceOf(address(this));
   if (currentUsdBalance < usdAmount) {
       revert InsufficientUSDBalance(currentUsdBalance, usdAmount);
   }
   ```
