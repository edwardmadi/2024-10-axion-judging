# Incorrect `notifyRewardAmount` in aerodrome utils contract

### Summary

The `notifyRewardAmount` function is used to supply bribes to the gauges. This function is implemented in the masterUtils contract and inherited by the other contracts.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/solidly-utils/contracts/MasterUtils.sol#L148

The issue is that the AerodromeUtils contract also inherits this. However, the aerodrome gauge contracts have a different interface.

The current implementation has the interface as so:

```solidity
function notifyRewardAmount(address rewardsToken, uint256 reward) external
```

But we can check on base that the aerodrome gauge contract has a different interface at: https://basescan.org/address/0xE7CfAea003D352B7c94a255566Da36b2DcE39B88#code

```solidity
function notifyRewardAmount(uint256 _amount) external override nonReentrant
```

The aerodrome contract does not take a `token` input. Due to this difference, the contracts wont work with aerodrome.

### Root Cause

The root cause is that the `notifyRewardAmount` function is implemented differently on Aerodrome. This can be checked from the link given above. The Aerodrome function takes only 1 parameter.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

Incompatibility with aerodrome contracts

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

Override the reward addition function in AerodromeUtils contract and implement it for the aerodrome interface.
