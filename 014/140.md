# Non-Compliance of Codebase to ERC-1504 Standards

### Summary

According to the AXION contest details, the codebase is supposed to be strictly compliant with the ERC-1504: Upgradable Smart Contract. The codebase does not follow the ERC-1504 specification.

The ERC-1504 contract consists of three parts:

Handler contract (implements Handler interface) defines operations and provides services. This contract can be upgraded;
Data contract keeps the resources (data) and is controlled by the Handler contract;
Upgrader contract (optional) deals with the voting mechanism and upgrades the Handler contract. The voters are pre-defined by the contract owner.

The Axion codebase does not follow this pattern in any way.
