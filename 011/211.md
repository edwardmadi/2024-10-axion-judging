# Frontrun initialize

### Summary

The lack of access control in the initialize function will cause unauthorized control of the contract for users as an attacker will front-run valid initialization transactions and take ownership of the whole contract and also set them as admin for the MasterAMO.sol.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV2AMO.sol#L62

In SolidlyV2AMO.sol:62, the `initialize` function lacks a proper ownership or role-based access control check, allowing any address to call it and set critical state variables such as ownership and contract configuration.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The `initialize` function does not enforce access control, allowing anyone to call it.
2. The contract has not yet been initialized, leaving critical configuration open for manipulation.

### External pre-conditions

1. The deployment of the contract must be public, allowing external entities to interact before legitimate initialization.
2. Network congestion and high gas prices may delay valid initialization transactions, giving an attacker an opportunity to front-run.

### Attack Path

1. The attacker monitors the blockchain for contract deployments with public initialization functions.
2. The attacker sends a transaction to the initialize function before the legitimate owner can do so.
3. The attacker sets themselves as the owner of the contract and configures other critical state variables.
4. The legitimate owner tries to initialize the contract but finds that the contract is already configured by the attacker.

### Impact

The protocol suffers complete loss of control over the contract initialization. The attacker gains control over the contract, potentially leading to a loss of funds or misconfiguration of the contract's state. This could result in unauthorized access to functions reserved for the legitimate owner, which can make the protocol to redeploy the contract. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, make sure that the initialize is called in the deployment script during deployment.
