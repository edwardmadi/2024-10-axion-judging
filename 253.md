# User could change allowance in Boost token, when contract in pause mode

### Summary

The missing modifier 'whenNotPaused' in BoostStablecoin.sol cause, that user could change allowance (call approve function) when pause mode is ON.  When contract has such modifier, all functions, which could change state of contract, should not execute when pause mode is on.

### Root Cause

In `BoostStablecoin.sol: 14` imports ERC20 contract from OZ ( https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/BoostStablecoin.sol#L14 )  , but there is not override function, which disable call approve when contract has pause mode is ON

### Internal pre-conditions

1. User with role PAUSER_ROLE call pause()
2. Other (general) user call approve and change allowance value 

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User with role PAUSER_ROLE call pause()
2. Other (general) user call approve and change allowance value 

### Impact

User could change allowance value, when contract has pause mode ON. 

The same issue has medium severity in OpenZeppelin report - https://solodit.xyz/issues/paused-token-contract-does-not-pause-allowance-changes-openzeppelin-none-auki-labs-audit-markdown

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add function which override approve function from OZ contract and add modifier whenNotPaused.
