# Token Order Assumption in SolidlyV2AMO and SolidlyV3AMO Will Cause Protocol Malfunction

### Summary

The incorrect assumption about token order in both `SolidlyV2AMO` and `SolidlyV3AMO` will cause a critical malfunction of the protocol as the contracts assume BOOST address is always less than USD address, which may not be true for all stablecoins, leading to incorrect swaps and liquidity operations.

### Root Cause

In `SolidlyV2AMO.sol` and `SolidlyV3AMO.sol`, several functions assume a fixed order of token addresses (`BOOST < USD`) without proper sorting. This assumption is incorrect as the protocol is designed to work with "[any USD-pegged token](https://discord.com/channels/812037309376495636/1293951215767388313/1295029589420282008)", some of which may have addresses lower than the BOOST token address.

1. In [`_mintAndSellBoost()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/c65e662999d0c79439703fc6713814b4ad023e01/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV3AMO.sol#L146):
```solidity
        boost < usd,
```

2. In [`_unfarmBuyBurn()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/c65e662999d0c79439703fc6713814b4ad023e01/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV3AMO.sol#L259):
```solidity
        boost > usd, // Determines if we are swapping USD for BOOST (true) or BOOST for USD (false)
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The protocol needs to be deployed and operational.
2. The `SolidlyV2AMO` and `SolidlyV3AMO` contracts need to be initialized with BOOST and a USD stablecoin address.

### External pre-conditions

1. A USD stablecoin with an address lower than the BOOST token address needs to be used with the protocol.

### Attack Path

1. The protocol is set up with a USD stablecoin that has a lower address than BOOST.
2. An `AMO_ROLE` calls functions like `mintSellFarm()`, `unfarmBuyBurn()`, or any function that internally uses `_mintAndSellBoost()` or `_unfarmBuyBurn()`.
3. These functions create swap routes or perform calculations assuming BOOST is always the first token (lower address).
4. The swap is executed with incorrect token order, leading to unintended token swaps or incorrect price calculations.

### Impact

Breaks core contract functionality as this issue renders the entire AMO system non-functional for certain stablecoin pairs.
