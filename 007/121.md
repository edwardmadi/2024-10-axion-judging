# `burnAndCollect` non-existent in most protocols

### Summary

The `_unfarmBuyBurn` function in the `SolidlyV3Amo.sol` contract calls the `pool.burnAndCollect` function to burn liquidity and collect tokens.

The devs also mention in their documentation at https://sticky-yarrow-52e.notion.site/AXION-Audit-Documentation-11bb3e443073802c949bd3700abad968 that they intend to support velodrome,aerodrome, thena and ramses pools.

The issue is that the pool contracts in these protocols dont have the `burnAndCollect` function.

Thena CL pool contract: https://bscscan.com/address/0x51bd5e6d3da9064d59bcaa5a76776560ab42ceb8#code
Ramses CL pool contract: https://arbiscan.io/address/0x6553aaee5a3a482a7d61bb5e093b05140fe17e21#code
Velodrome: https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xc28aD28853A547556780BEBF7847628501A3bCbb#code
Aerodrome: https://basescan.org/address/0xeC8E5342B19977B4eF8892e02D8DAEcfa1315831#code

All the contracts have separate `burn` and `collect` functions. Only solidlyV3 implements this `burnAndCollect` function. However, since the intention is to support all of these, this is an issue.

### Root Cause

The main issue is that while solidlyV3 implements a `burnAndCollect` function, none of the other intended target pools do. Thus there is an incompatibility.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

Incompatibility with all other protocols.

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

Consider using `burn` and `collect` separately since those functions are present in all the pools.
