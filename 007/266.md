# The `SolidlyV2AMO._mintAndSellBoost()` function does not work with Velodrome and Aerodrome

### Summary
The protocol mints `BOOST` tokens and sells them for USD using the `_mintAndSellBoost()` function for SolidlyV2 DEXes. Since Velodrome and Aerodrome are parts of the SolidlyV2 DEXes, they should be compatible. However, the `_mintAndSellBoost()` function does not work with Velodrome and Aerodrome due to incorrect `route` structure.

### Root Cause
In the `_mintAndSellBoost()` function, it mints `BOOST` tokens and swaps them for USD tokens.
To swap `BOOST` tokens for USD tokens, it defines the routes using `route` structure in `ISolidlyRouter`.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/c65e662999d0c79439703fc6713814b4ad023e01/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV2AMO.sol#L167-L169
```solidity
File: liquidity-amo\contracts\SolidlyV2AMO.sol
167:         // Define the route to swap BOOST tokens for USD tokens
168:         ISolidlyRouter.route[] memory routes = new ISolidlyRouter.route[](1);
169:         routes[0] = ISolidlyRouter.route(boost, usd, true);

File: liquidity-amo\contracts\interfaces\v2\ISolidlyRouter.sol
5:     struct route {
6:         address from;
7:         address to;
8:         bool stable;
9:     }
```

Then, it executes the swap with the routes defined before. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/c65e662999d0c79439703fc6713814b4ad023e01/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV2AMO.sol#L174-L181
```solidity
File: liquidity-amo\contracts\SolidlyV2AMO.sol
174:         // Execute the swap and store the amounts of tokens involved
175:         uint256[] memory amounts = ISolidlyRouter(router).swapExactTokensForTokens(
176:             boostAmount,
177:             minUsdAmountOut,
178:   @>        routes,
179:             address(this), 
180:             deadline
181:         );
```

However, the `route` structure used in Velodrome and Aerodrome differs from the `route` structure defined in the `_mintAndSellBoost()` function.
The `route` structure required for Velodrome and Aerodrome is as follows:

Velodrome : https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xa062aE8A9c5e11aaA026fc2670B0D65cCc8B2858#code:~:text=File%206%20of%2018%20%3A%20IRouter.sol L5-L10

Aerodrom : https://basescan.org/address/0xcF77a3Ba9A5CA399B7c97c74d54e5b1Beb874E43#code L710-L715

```solidity
   struct Route {
         address from;
         address to;
         bool stable;
         address factory;
     }
```

As a result, the `_mintAndSellBoost()` function does not work with Velodrome and Aerodrome due to the incorrect `route` structure.

### Internal pre-conditions

For convenience, let's assume that the USD token is `USDC` from this point forward.
- Protocol team is going to mint additional `BOOST` and sell them for `USDC` to bring the price back down to peg. 

### External pre-conditions

- The `BOOST-USDC` price diverges from peg and `BOOST` is trading above `$1` in Velodrome.

### Attack Path

- Alice(protocol team) calls the `mintAndSellBoost()` function.

It reverts.

### Impact

The `mintAndSellBoost()`, `mintSellFarm()` functions will be permanently DoSed for Velodrome and Aerodrome.
Protocol team can't mint additional `BOOST` and sell them for `USDC` to bring the price back down to peg.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Use the correct `route` structure for Velodrome.
