# When the pool is unbalanced, users can make unfair profit by swapping before `unfarmBuyBurn`

### Summary

A user can exploit BOOST swaps followed by the `unfarmBuyBurn` function to profit from BOOST price changes. By swapping USDC for BOOST, then triggers a rebalancing via `unfarmBuyBurn` to correct the imbalance and swap BOOST back at a higher price, making an instant profit.

### Root Cause

Design of the `unfarmBuyBurn` function allows manipulation of pool reserves by swapping USDC for BOOST before rebalancing. The function does not consider reserve changes caused by users swapping USDC for BOOST before rebalancing, allowing them to swap back at a higher price afterward.

```solidity
function _unfarmBuyBurn() internal override returns (uint256 liquidity, uint256 newBoostPrice) {
        (uint256 boostReserve, uint256 usdReserve) = getReserves();

        uint256 usdNeeded = (((boostReserve - usdReserve) / 2) * usdBuyRatio) / FACTOR;
        uint256 totalLp = IERC20Upgradeable(pool).totalSupply();
        liquidity = (usdNeeded * totalLp) / usdReserve;

        // Readjust the LP amount and USD needed to balance price before removing LP
        // ( rationale: we first compute the amount of USD needed to rebalance the price in the pool; then first-order adjust for the fact that removing liquidity/totalLP fraction of the pool increases price impact —— less liquidity needs to be removed )
        // liquidity -= liquidity ** 2 / totalLp;

        _unfarmBuyBurn(
            liquidity,
            (liquidity * boostReserve) / totalLp, // the minBoostRemove argument
            toUsdAmount(usdNeeded), // the minUsdRemove argument
            usdNeeded, // the minBoostAmountOut argument
            block.timestamp + 1 // deadline is next block as the computation is valid instantly
        );

        newBoostPrice = boostPrice();
    }
 ```

### Internal pre-conditions

- The pool reserves are for example: 1000 BOOST and 500 USDC (BOOST price should be lower for this scenario to happen)
- The `unfarmBuyBurn` function is publicly accessible and can be triggered to rebalance the pool.

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

T=0 
pool reserves = 1000 BOOST - 500 USDC

T=1 
Bob sells 125 USDC to the pool, getting 200 BOOST back. (using x*y=k, assuming 0 swap fee)
pool reserves = 800 BOOST - 625 USDC
       
T=2 
Somebody calls `unfarmBuyBurn` to rebalance the pool.
 usdNeeded = 70 
        usdBuyRatio = 0.8
        totalSupply = 700
        89.6 BOOST - 70 USDC will be removed.
        pool reserves = 710.4 BOOST - 555 USDC
        removed 70 USDC is sold for BOOST to complete unfarmBuyBurn
        Final balances of the pool after `unfarmBuyBurn` 630.83 BOOST - 625 USDC
T=3 
After `unfarmBuyBurn`,
        poolReserves = 630.83 BOOST - 625 USDC, previously
        Bob sells his 200 BOOST to 151 USDC, making net profit of 26 USDC. (+20%) (Again, x*y=k assuming 0 swap fees)
