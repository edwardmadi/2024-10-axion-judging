# Liquidity draining with continuous `unfarmBuyBurn` calls and BOOST sells by a malicious user

### Summary

The removal of liquidity during the `unfarmBuyBurn` function can cause a USDC drain for the liquidity pool, as a user can repeatedly sell BOOST tokens to the pool and trigger unfarmBuyBurn, which will continuously remove liquidity until the pool runs out of USDC.

### Root Cause

When BOOST price is under $1 which is a high likely scenario, protocol uses `unfarmBuyBurn` function to rise BOOST price again to $1.
1. Withdraws specified amount of LP from the pool
2. Buys BOOST from the pool with the withdrawn USDC
3. Burns excess and bought BOOST.
4. In the end, pool reserves are shrinked, prices are rebalanced.

```solidity
function _unfarmBuyBurn(
        uint256 liquidity,
        uint256 minBoostRemove,
        uint256 minUsdRemove,
        uint256 minBoostAmountOut,
        uint256 deadline
    )
        internal
        override
        returns (uint256 boostRemoved, uint256 usdRemoved, uint256 usdAmountIn, uint256 boostAmountOut)
    {
        // Withdraw the specified amount of liquidity tokens from the gauge
        IGauge(gauge).withdraw(liquidity);

        // Approve the transfer of liquidity tokens to the router for removal
        IERC20Upgradeable(pool).approve(router, liquidity);

        uint256 usdBalanceBefore = balanceOfToken(usd);
        // Remove liquidity and store the amounts of USD and BOOST tokens received
        (boostRemoved, usdRemoved) = ISolidlyRouter(router).removeLiquidity(
            boost,
            usd,
            true,
            liquidity,
            minBoostRemove,
            minUsdRemove,
            address(this),
            deadline
        );
        uint256 usdBalanceAfter = balanceOfToken(usd);

        // we check that each USDC buys more than 1 BOOST (repegging is not an expense for the protocol)
        if (usdRemoved != usdBalanceAfter - usdBalanceBefore)
            revert UsdAmountOutMismatch(usdRemoved, usdBalanceAfter - usdBalanceBefore);

        // Ensure the BOOST amount is greater than or equal to the USD amount
        if ((boostRemoved * validRemovingRatio) / FACTOR < toBoostAmount(usdRemoved))
            revert InvalidRatioToRemoveLiquidity();

        // Define the route to swap USD tokens for BOOST tokens
        ISolidlyRouter.route[] memory routes = new ISolidlyRouter.route[](1);
        routes[0] = ISolidlyRouter.route(usd, boost, true);

        // Approve the transfer of usd tokens to the router
        IERC20Upgradeable(usd).approve(router, usdRemoved);

        if (minBoostAmountOut < toBoostAmount(usdRemoved)) minBoostAmountOut = toBoostAmount(usdRemoved);

        // Execute the swap and store the amounts of tokens involved
        uint256[] memory amounts = ISolidlyRouter(router).swapExactTokensForTokens(
            usdRemoved,
            minBoostAmountOut,
            routes,
            address(this),
            deadline
        );

        // Burn the BOOST tokens received from the liquidity
        // Burn the BOOST tokens received from the swap
        usdAmountIn = amounts[0];
        boostAmountOut = amounts[1];
        IBoostStablecoin(boost).burn(boostRemoved + boostAmountOut);

        emit UnfarmBuyBurn(boostRemoved, usdRemoved, liquidity, boostAmountOut);
    }
```

The design of the `unfarmBuyBurn` function allows the removal of USDC liquidity during the rebalancing process without limiting the number of consecutive calls or accounting for depleted USDC reserves. This can lead to continuous USDC depletion when a malicious user sells BOOST tokens to the pool and repeatedly triggers the `unfarmBuyBurn` function.
Attacker can easily get BOOST from another pools to execute this attack.

### Internal pre-conditions

The `unfarmBuyBurn` function allows liquidity removal during the rebalancing process, which decreases USDC reserves.


### External pre-conditions

The pool must allow public access to the `unfarmBuyBurn` function, meaning anyone can trigger it to rebalance the pool.

### Attack Path

1. The attacker swaps a large amount of BOOST tokens for USDC, depleting some of the USDC reserves in the pool.
2. The attacker triggers the `unfarmBuyBurn` function, which removes a portion of the remaining USDC liquidity while rebalancing the BOOST price.
3. The attacker repeats the process by selling more BOOST, draining USDC reserves and triggering `unfarmBuyBurn` again.
4. The attack is repeated until the USDC reserves in the pool are completely depleted.
