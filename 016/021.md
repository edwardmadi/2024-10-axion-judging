# Lack of Nonce Mechanism in Voting Function Leading to Replay Attacks

### Summary

The `vote` function in the `MasterUtils` contract lacks a nonce mechanism, making it vulnerable to replay attacks. This vulnerability allows an attacker to resend a previously valid transaction, potentially altering voting outcomes and compromising the integrity of the voting process.

### Root Cause

The `vote` function does not implement a nonce mechanism to ensure the uniqueness of each transaction. This absence allows the same transaction to be processed multiple times if resent by an attacker.
```solidity
094:     function vote(
095:         uint256 tokenId,
096:         address[] calldata poolVote,
097:         uint256[] calldata weights
098:     ) external nonReentrant onlyRole(OPERATOR_ROLE) {
               // no nonce checking.
099:         if (checkIncreaseUnlockTime(tokenId, maxtime)) _increaseUnlockTime(tokenId, maxtime);
100:         IMasterVoter(voter).vote(tokenId, poolVote, weights);
101:         emit Voted(tokenId, poolVote, weights);
102:     }
```

### Scenario

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/solidly-utils/contracts/MasterUtils.sol#L94-L102

### Attack Path

Scenario:
1. A valid vote transaction is sent by a legitimate user.
2. An attacker captures this transaction and resends it multiple times.
3. The system processes these repeated transactions, skewing the voting results and potentially leading to unintended outcomes.


### Impact

Manipulation of voting results.

### Mitigation

- Add a mapping to store used nonces for each `tokenId`.
- Include a `nonce` parameter and check to ensure it hasn't been used before.
```diff
+ mapping(uint256 => uint256) private usedNonces;

function vote(
    uint256 tokenId,
    address[] calldata poolVote,
    uint256[] calldata weights,
+   uint256 nonce
) external nonReentrant onlyRole(OPERATOR_ROLE) {
+   require(nonce != usedNonces[tokenId], "Nonce already used");
+   usedNonces[tokenId] = nonce;

    if (checkIncreaseUnlockTime(tokenId, maxtime)) _increaseUnlockTime(tokenId, maxtime);
    IMasterVoter(voter).vote(tokenId, poolVote, weights);
    emit Voted(tokenId, poolVote, weights);
}
```
