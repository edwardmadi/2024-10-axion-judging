# Rebalance Manipulation via Flash Loan Attack Leading to Token Minting/Burning Imbalance - Medium

### Summary

Flash loans can imbalance the pool, users can initiate re-balance at that incorrect state and attackers can profit off this invalid state.

### Root Cause

The choice to allow users to initiate balancing is an issue. The documentation states the following:

> users can rebalance through the contract or run their own bots.

This is present in [Readme.md](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion-0xauditagent?tab=readme-ov-file#q-are-there-any-off-chain-mechanisms-for-the-protocol-keeper-bots-arbitrage-bots-etc-we-assume-they-wont-misbehave-delay-or-go-offline-unless-specified-otherwise)

User can initiate a rebalancing at an incorrect state which either lead to minting or burning of excessive tokens.

### Internal pre-conditions

The only internal condition that needs to be met:

1. User / Malicious actor needs to call the rebalance in `publicAMO.sol`

### External pre-conditions

1. Attacker takes a flash loan
2. Imbalances the ratio inside the pool

### Attack Path

1. Take a flash loan which imbalances the pool. In [SolidlyV2AMO: 390-393](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV2AMO.sol#L390-L393)
```solidity
function boostPrice() public view override returns (uint256 price) {
    uint256 amountOut = IPair(pool).getAmountOut(10 ** boostDecimals, boost);
    price = amountOut / 10 ** (usdDecimals - PRICE_DECIMALS);
}
```
2. Attacker disguised as a user could initiate re-balance ([refer docs](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion-0xauditagent?tab=readme-ov-file#q-are-there-any-off-chain-mechanisms-for-the-protocol-keeper-bots-arbitrage-bots-etc-we-assume-they-wont-misbehave-delay-or-go-offline-unless-specified-otherwise)) at this **incorrect** state leading to minting/burning of the tokens. This could lead to more minting/burning of BOOST tokens than required.
3. Leverage benefit from the imbalanced pool. For example, `unfarmBuyBurn` can be triggered and drain protocol funds.
4. Rebalancing after this can be costly endeavour for the protocol.

Note: The sanity checks for example in [MasterAMO.sol:306](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/MasterAMO.sol#L306) are not enough to prevent this because it itself uses `boostPrice()` to check. 

### Impact

The impact:

1. Minting of too many tokens thus crashing the price
2. Burning of too many tokens can drain funds, selling BOOST tokens for a bad price
