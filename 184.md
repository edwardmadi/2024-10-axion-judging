# The setWhitelistedTokens function is never called and cannot be called at all later, this causes no tokens to be on the whitelist and the getReward function will always revert

### Summary

In the `SolidlyV2AMO.sol` contract there is a `setWhitelistedTokens` function. This function is useful for entering tokens as rewards on the whitelist. This function can only be called by `SETTER_ROLE`. The problem here is that this function is never called when initiating the contract and this function cannot be called later because `SETTER_ROLE` has been revoked during the initiation process.

```solidity
function initialize(
        address admin,
        address boost_,
        address usd_,
        address boostMinter_,
        address router_,
        address gauge_,
        address rewardVault_,
        uint256 tokenId_,
        bool useTokenId_,
        uint256 boostMultiplier_,
        uint24 validRangeWidth_,
        uint24 validRemovingRatio_,
        uint256 boostLowerPriceSell_,
        uint256 boostUpperPriceBuy_,
        uint256 boostSellRatio_,
        uint256 usdBuyRatio_
    ) public initializer {
        if (router_ == address(0) || gauge_ == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
        address pool_ = ISolidlyRouter(router_).pairFor(usd_, boost_, true);
        super.initialize(admin, boost_, usd_, pool_, boostMinter_);

        router = router_;
        gauge = gauge_;

        _grantRole(SETTER_ROLE, msg.sender);
        setVault(rewardVault_);
        setTokenId(tokenId_, useTokenId_);
        setParams(
            boostMultiplier_,
            validRangeWidth_,
            validRemovingRatio_,
            boostLowerPriceSell_,
            boostUpperPriceBuy_,
            boostSellRatio_,
            usdBuyRatio_
        );
        _revokeRole(SETTER_ROLE, msg.sender);
    }
```

Additionally, there is no external function to call the `_grantRole` function which is used to add an address as a `SETTER_ROLE`.

### Root Cause

*In [SolidlyV2AMO.sol:62-100](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV2AMO.sol#L62-L100) there is missing call on `setWhitelistedTokens`*

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

`getReward` function always revert and user cant claim the reward

```solidity
if (!whitelistedRewardTokens[tokens[i]]) revert TokenNotWhitelisted(tokens[i]);
```

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider call `setWhitelistedTokens` when contract initiated
