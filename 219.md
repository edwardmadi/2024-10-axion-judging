# Improper Upgradeability Implementation

### Summary

Insufficient upgradeability in several contracts could result in significant functionality loss and security risks for the protocol, as future upgrades might fail or behave unpredictably, potentially leading to loss of funds or contract state.

### Root Cause

The upgradeability implementation in BoostStablecoin.sol, Minter.sol, MasterAMO.sol, and other upgradeable contracts is incomplete, lacking essential elements of the ERC1967 proxy pattern, UUPS, or Transparent Proxy patterns from OpenZeppelin.

## FOR transparent 
This setup doesn't creates a clear separation between the logic contract (BoostStablecoin), the proxy (BoostStablecoinProxy), and the admin contract (BoostStablecoinProxyAdmin). The ProxyAdmin contract will be used to manage upgrades and admin functions for the proxy for transpparent

## FOR UUPS
and missing to the __UUPSUpgradeable_init() function in initiliaze function for UUPS 


### Internal pre-conditions

1. Contracts are deployed without proper upgradeability implementation.
2. No upgrade mechanism is correctly set up in the contracts.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The protocol aims to upgrade a contract to address a vulnerability or add features.  
2. The upgrade fails due to flawed upgradeability implementation.  
3. The contract either remains vulnerable or lacks essential features.  
4. In a worst-case scenario, an attacker exploits the unresolved vulnerability.

### Impact

Failure to implement essential upgrades for addressing vulnerabilities or enhancing features.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Example Fix (UUPS Pattern):

import "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/proxy/utils/UUPSUpgradeable.sol";

contract BoostStablecoin is
    Initializable,
    ERC20BurnableUpgradeable,
    PausableUpgradeable,
    AccessControlEnumerableUpgradeable,
    UUPSUpgradeable
{
    function initialize(address admin) external initializer {
        __ERC20_init("Boost", "BOOST");
        __ERC20Burnable_init();
        __Pausable_init();
        __AccessControl_init();
        __UUPSUpgradeable_init();
        _grantRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, admin);
    }

    function _authorizeUpgrade(address newImplementation) internal override onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
        // Add any additional upgrade logic here
    }
}
