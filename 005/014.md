# Medium: The function notifyRewardAmounts will fail when the previous value is not zero.

### Summary

Some ERC20 tokens like USDT require resetting the approval to 0 first before being able to reset it to another value. 

### Root Cause

-In MasterUtils.sol:147 there are some mistakes.
`https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/solidly-utils/contracts/MasterUtils.sol#L147`

### Internal pre-conditions

1. OPERATOR_ROLE did the notifyRewardAmounts(bribes, rewards, amounts)
2. But the user didn't take away the tokens using transferFrom( _from, _to, _value)

### External pre-conditions

1. And then address[] bribes has the same user that allowed[contract][user] != 0 the transaction will fail.
2. So the other users will not get the rewards.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Medium
The group of liquidators will not get the rewards because of some user that didn't take away all rewards.

### PoC

In the source code of USDT token in EVM chain
```solidity
    function approve(address _spender, uint _value) public onlyPayloadSize(2 * 32) {

        // To change the approve amount you first have to reduce the addresses`
        //  allowance to zero by calling `approve(_spender, 0)` if it is not
        //  already 0 to mitigate the race condition described here:
        //  https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729
        require(!((_value != 0) && (allowed[msg.sender][_spender] != 0)));

        allowed[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;
        Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value);
    }
```


### Mitigation

It should be sure that the value is not zero.
```diff
    function notifyRewardAmounts(
        address[] calldata bribes,
        address[] calldata rewards,
        uint256[] calldata amounts
    ) external nonReentrant onlyRole(OPERATOR_ROLE) {
        if (bribes.length != rewards.length || bribes.length != amounts.length) revert ArrayLengthsMismatch();

        uint256 currentPeriod = (block.timestamp / 1 weeks) * 1 weeks;

        if (currentPeriod > activePeriod) {
            activePeriod = currentPeriod;
            bribeTimes[activePeriod] = 0;
        }

        if (bribeTimes[activePeriod] + bribes.length > bribeTimesPerWeek) revert BribeTimesPerWeekLimitExceeded();

        for (uint i = 0; i < bribes.length; i++) {
            if (amounts[i] > bribeAmountLimit[bribes[i]])
                revert BribeAmountLimitExceeded({bribeAmount: amounts[i], limitAmount: bribeAmountLimit[bribes[i]]});
+         uint256 allowance = IERC20(rewards[i]).allowance(address(this), brides[i]);
+         if(allowance != 0 ) IERC20(rewards[i]).approve(bribes[i], 0);
-            IERC20(rewards[i]).approve(bribes[i], amounts[i]);
+           IERC20(rewards[i]).approve(bribes[i], amounts[i] + allowance);
            IBribe(bribes[i]).notifyRewardAmount(rewards[i], amounts[i]);
        }

        bribeTimes[activePeriod] += bribes.length;

        emit RewardAmountsNotified(bribes, rewards, amounts);
    }
```
