# Bribing can be happen multiple times in a weak by accidently.

### Summary

The `MasterUtils::notifyRewardAmounts` function checks that the amount is going to be approve for each bribes should not be greater than `bribeAmountLimit`.
```solidity
if (amounts[i] > bribeAmountLimit[bribes[i]])
                revert BribeAmountLimitExceeded({bribeAmount: amounts[i], limitAmount: bribeAmountLimit[bribes[i]]});
```

 However,  the function does not updates the `bribeAmountLimit` for each bribes, which mean it is possible to double the amount for each bribes in each weak.             

### Root Cause

The `bribeAmountLimit` is not updated for each bribes.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

The operator might unintentionally approve bribes more than once in a given period (e.g., twice in the same week),

### Impact

The bribing can be accidently happen multiple times.

### PoC

- Let's say `bribeAmountLimit` = 100 for bribe1 and bribe2, `bribeTimesPerWeek` = 4.
- On first transaction operator approves 50 for bribe1 and bribe2 now `bribeTimesPerWeek` = 2.
- Now in second transaction operator can approve 100 for both bribe2 and bribe2.



### Mitigation

Update the `bribeAmountLimit` for each bribes, which will allow bribing to happen only one time in a weak.
