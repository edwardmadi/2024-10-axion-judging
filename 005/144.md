# Bribe amount limit can be bypassed in MasterUtils by passing the same bribe contract multiple times in notifyRewardAmounts

### Summary

Bribe amount limit can be bypassed in MasterUtils by passing the same bribe contract multiple times in notifyRewardAmounts

### Root Cause

The bribe limit `bribeAmountLimit` can be bypassed for any bribe up to a factor of `bribeTimesPerWeek` by passing in the same bribe contract multiple times.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/solidly-utils/contracts/MasterUtils.sol#L142-L149
```solidity
        if (bribeTimes[activePeriod] + bribes.length > bribeTimesPerWeek) revert BribeTimesPerWeekLimitExceeded();

        for (uint i = 0; i < bribes.length; i++) {
            if (amounts[i] > bribeAmountLimit[bribes[i]])
                revert BribeAmountLimitExceeded({bribeAmount: amounts[i], limitAmount: bribeAmountLimit[bribes[i]]});
            IERC20(rewards[i]).approve(bribes[i], amounts[i]);
            IBribe(bribes[i]).notifyRewardAmount(rewards[i], amounts[i]);
        }
```

Just set `bribes`, `rewards` array lengths to `bribeTimesPerWeek` in beginning of period and then each element is the same bribe and max limit. There is no check preventing this. (It can also be sent multiple times in multiple transactions with shorter arrays up to the bribeTimesPerWeek.)

Sample code from Thena. Shows calling notifyRewardAmount multiple times is additive and not assignment of reward as it adds to _lastReward. https://github.com/ThenafiBNB/THENA-Contracts/blob/main/contracts/Bribes.sol#L327-L345
```solidity

    /// @notice Notify a bribe amount
    /// @dev    Rewards are saved into NEXT EPOCH mapping. 
    function notifyRewardAmount(address _rewardsToken, uint256 reward) external nonReentrant {
        require(isRewardToken[_rewardsToken], "reward token not verified");
        IERC20(_rewardsToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),reward);

        uint256 _startTimestamp = IMinter(minter).active_period() + WEEK; //period points to the current thursday. Bribes are distributed from next epoch (thursday)
        if(firstBribeTimestamp == 0){
            firstBribeTimestamp = _startTimestamp;
        }

        uint256 _lastReward = rewardData[_rewardsToken][_startTimestamp].rewardsPerEpoch;
        
        rewardData[_rewardsToken][_startTimestamp].rewardsPerEpoch = _lastReward + reward;
        rewardData[_rewardsToken][_startTimestamp].lastUpdateTime = block.timestamp;
        rewardData[_rewardsToken][_startTimestamp].periodFinish = _startTimestamp + WEEK;

        emit RewardAdded(_rewardsToken, reward, _startTimestamp);
    }
```

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Bribe limit is bypassed and more tokens than expected can be lost to paying bribes. The role is privileged to operator so it should not be expected to be deliberately called to do so but it is always possible for operator to make mistakes like duping a bribe.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Subtract from the bribeAmountLimit each time reward is added.
