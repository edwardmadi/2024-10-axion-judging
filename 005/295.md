# `bribeAmountLimit` does not support cases where there are multiple reward tokens for one bribe.


### Summary

In `MasterUtils.sol`, when adding rewards for bribes, as long as the reward token is supported for the bribe, it can be added. However, the current implementation of `MasterUtils.sol` only supports one reward token for each bribe.

### Root Cause

For each bribe, there is a `bribeAmountLimit[bribe]` that limits the amount of token that is sent as rewards. However, if a bribe has multiple reward tokens, it cannot be handled by a single limit.

For example, both WETH and USDC are used as reward tokens in a single bribe. They have different decimals, so it would make no sense sharing the same limit.

```solidity
    function notifyRewardAmounts(
        address[] calldata bribes,
        address[] calldata rewards,
        uint256[] calldata amounts
    ) external nonReentrant onlyRole(OPERATOR_ROLE) {
        if (bribes.length != rewards.length || bribes.length != amounts.length) revert ArrayLengthsMismatch();

        uint256 currentPeriod = (block.timestamp / 1 weeks) * 1 weeks;

        if (currentPeriod > activePeriod) {
            activePeriod = currentPeriod;
            bribeTimes[activePeriod] = 0;
        }

        if (bribeTimes[activePeriod] + bribes.length > bribeTimesPerWeek) revert BribeTimesPerWeekLimitExceeded();

        for (uint i = 0; i < bribes.length; i++) {
@>          if (amounts[i] > bribeAmountLimit[bribes[i]])
@>              revert BribeAmountLimitExceeded({bribeAmount: amounts[i], limitAmount: bribeAmountLimit[bribes[i]]});
            IERC20(rewards[i]).approve(bribes[i], amounts[i]);
            IBribe(bribes[i]).notifyRewardAmount(rewards[i], amounts[i]);
        }

        bribeTimes[activePeriod] += bribes.length;

        emit RewardAmountsNotified(bribes, rewards, amounts);
    }

    function setBribeAmountLimit(address bribe, uint256 amount) external onlyRole(SETTER_ROLE) {
@>      bribeAmountLimit[bribe] = amount;
        emit BribeAmountLimitSet(bribe, amount);
    }
```

BribeVotingReward.sol (from Aerodrome)
```solidity
	contract BribeVotingReward is VotingReward {
	    constructor(
	        address _forwarder,
	        address _voter,
	        address[] memory _rewards
	    ) VotingReward(_forwarder, _voter, _rewards) {}

	    /// @inheritdoc VotingReward
	    function notifyRewardAmount(address token, uint256 amount) external override nonReentrant {
	        address sender = _msgSender();

	        // @audit-note: Support multiple reward tokens.
@>	        if (!isReward[token]) {
	            if (!IVoter(voter).isWhitelistedToken(token)) revert NotWhitelisted();
	            isReward[token] = true;
	            rewards.push(token);
	        }

	        _notifyRewardAmount(sender, token, amount);
	    }
	}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

N/A

### External pre-conditions

1. Multiple reward tokens are used for a bribe.

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

`bribeAmountLimit[]` cannot be used for a bribe with multiple reward tokens.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Use a different limit for each token: `bribeAmountLimit[bribe][token]`.
