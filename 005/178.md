# Repeating Arrays will cause duplicate reward distribution and over-allocation, impacting reward pool integrity

### Summary

The lack of proper checking of the reward allocation limit in the notifyRewardAmounts() method in the MasterUtils.sol contract will put the integrity of the reward pool at risk of duplicate reward allocation, as the operator will repeatedly allocate rewards that exceed the established limit.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/solidly-utils/contracts/MasterUtils.sol#L128

In *MasterUtils.sol: notifyRewardAmounts* there is a missing check that ensures rewards are not distributed repeatedly within the same time frame, as well as a check to prevent the total distributed reward from exceeding the predefined amount. Specifically:

1. There is no mechanism to verify that rewards for the same bribes have not already been distributed in the same period, which can lead to duplicate rewards being distributed.
2. There is insufficient enforcement of the `bribeAmountLimit` for each bribe address in every distribution cycle. If the cumulative reward amounts exceed the predefined limits (`bribeAmountLimit`), this could result in excess rewards being distributed beyond the set limit.

These issues can lead to incorrect reward allocations and potential exploitation, where a malicious actor or an unintended system behavior might cause the same bribe to receive rewards more than once or more than the specified limit.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Operator needs to call `notifyRewardAmounts()` to set rewards for bribes other than valid, unique bribe addresses.
2. Operator needs to call `setBribeAmountLimit()` to set bribeAmountLimit to be higher than safe limit for specific bribe addresses.
3. Operator needs to fail to check if bribeTimes[activePeriod] has exceeded bribeTimesPerWeek before setting rewards.
4. Operator needs to trigger reward distribution within activePeriod without checking if the bribes have already received rewards in that period.
5. Operator needs to allow cumulative rewards for bribes to exceed bribeAmountLimit without validation on distribution frequency.

These conditions allow multiple reward allocations to occur, leading to potential reward overflows or duplications.

### External pre-conditions

Need bribes to have rewards

### Attack Path

The attacker calls notifyRewardAmounts() with a carefully crafted list of bribes, rewards, and amounts, ensuring that the amounts are close to but not exceeding bribeAmountLimit. The attacker also makes sure that all three parameters in notifyRewardAmounts() are equal.
For example, address[] calldata bribes: address[address(1),address(1),address(1),address(1),address(1)]
address[] calldata rewards:
uint256[] calldata amounts:[bribeAmountLimit-1,bribeAmountLimit-1,bribeAmountLimit-1,bribeAmountLimit-1,bribeAmountLimit-1]

### Impact

The protocol suffers an approximate loss of rewards distribution fairness as the attacker can exploit the rewards distribution mechanism to bypass limits, leading to excessive or repeated allocation of rewards to certain addresses. The attacker gains the excess rewards by manipulating the input data.
