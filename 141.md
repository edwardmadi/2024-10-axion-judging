# malicious/compromised operator can drain the contract

### Summary

A malicious or compromised address with granted `OPERATOR_ROLE`  can drain the contract .

### Root Cause

According to the  [README](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/solidly-utils/README.md?plain=1#L57)  :
>### Roles
>- **OPERATOR_ROLE**: Can vote and poke in the governance system, claim bribes and fees, notify rewards and manage bribes. 



Also according to the [README](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/solidly-utils/README.md?plain=1#L44):
>- **Withdrawal Functions**:  
>  Withdrawals are restricted to the multisig wallet, adding security in case of a compromised key.
>  - `msigWithdrawERC20`: Withdraw ERC20 tokens to the multisig wallet.
>  - `msigWithdrawERC721`: Withdraw ERC721 tokens to the multisig wallet.

However, the function [swapperWithdraw( )](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/solidly-utils/contracts/MasterUtils.sol#L202) allows addresses with the   `OPERATOR_ROLE` role to transfer any  amount  of token from the contract

### Impact

a compromised/malicious  operator will drain the contract.

### PoC

```solidity

    function swapperWithdraw(address token, uint256 amount) external onlyRole(OPERATOR_ROLE) { 
        if (token == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
//@audit-issue : transfer any amount of token from the contract to msg.sender
        IERC20(token).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
        emit SwapperWithdrawn(token, msg.sender, amount);
    }
```

### Mitigation

Ensure that addresses with the `OPERATOR_ROLE` role can  only do the following 
1. vote and poke in the governance system
2.  claim bribes and fees
3.  notify rewards and manage bribe
