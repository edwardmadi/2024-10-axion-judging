# Protocol is not compatible with USD pegged cUSDCv3

### Summary

As stated in the contest README, all USD-backed stablecoins are supported. However, **cUSDCv3 is not compatible** with the current implementation of the protocol. This is due to how its `transfer()` function works.

If a user specifies an amount greater than their balance, only the available balance will be sent, and the transaction will **not fail**. This can cause unexpected behavior, as the protocol expects transactions to either succeed or fail completely.

>The right way to transfer the entire balance in Compound V3 is to transfer uint256 max value. Specifying the entire balance can be a bit tricky because it increases every second.

### Internal pre-conditions

Use cUSDCv3 as collateral
### External pre-conditions

N/A
### Attack Path

User calls `mint()` in `Minter.sol`.
User will not have the passed `amount`.
Only the user current balance will be added to the treasury.
Amount of boost tokens that will be minted will be equal to passed `amount` which will be higher than the transferred cUSDCv3.

### Impact

User are able to mint boost tokens without the needed collateral.
### PoC

N/A
### Mitigation

As sponser noted, there would be whitelisted tokens, so no mitigation is needed.
