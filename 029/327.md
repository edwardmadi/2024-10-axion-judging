# The `_unfarmBuyBurn` function in `SolidlyV3AMO` is vulnerable due to not approving the tokens

### Summary

In the `SolidlyV3AMO.sol` contract, the `_unfarmBuyBurn` function is tasked with removing liquidity from a pool, utilizing that liquidity to purchase BOOST tokens, and then burning the BOOST tokens. However, this function does not grant the required **approval** for the pool tokens before invoking the `burnAndCollect` function on the `SolidlyV3Pool` contract. Without this approval, the liquidity tokens remain inaccessible to the pool, causing the `burnAndCollect` function to fail. Consequently, the `_unfarmBuyBurn` function is unable to remove liquidity, preventing the burning of BOOST tokens to maintain Boost token price.

### Root Cause

The _unfarmBuyBurn function carries out several tasks, such as:

Removing liquidity from a Uniswap V3-style pool using burnAndCollect.
Swapping USD for BOOST.
Burning the acquired BOOST tokens to decrease the supply.
However, in the call to burnAndCollect, the function tries to use liquidity tokens, but no approval has been given for these tokens. The burnAndCollect function needs permission for the pool to access the contract's liquidity tokens, but the _unfarmBuyBurn function doesnâ€™t provide that approval. As a result, the transaction will fail when trying to burn and collect the liquidity, rendering the entire _unfarmBuyBurn function ineffective.
