# Missing Approval for Liquidity Tokens in `_unfarmBuyBurn` Function

### Summary

In the `SolidlyV3AMO.sol` contract, the `_unfarmBuyBurn` function is responsible for removing liquidity from a pool, using the liquidity to buy BOOST tokens, and subsequently burning the BOOST tokens. However, this function does not approve the necessary pool tokens before calling the `burnAndCollect` function on the `SolidlyV3Pool` contract. Without this approval, the liquidity tokens cannot be accessed by the pool, causing the `burnAndCollect` function to fail. As a result, the `_unfarmBuyBurn` function will not be able to remove liquidity, and the BOOST tokens cannot be burned.

### Root Cause

The `_unfarmBuyBurn` function performs multiple operations, including:

1. Removing liquidity from a Uniswap V3-style pool using burnAndCollect.
2. Swapping USD for BOOST.
3. Burning the collected BOOST tokens to reduce supply.

In the `burnAndCollect` function call, the contract attempts to use liquidity tokens, but there is no approval granted for these tokens. Specifically, the burnAndCollect function requires the pool to have permission to use the contractâ€™s liquidity tokens, but `_unfarmBuyBurn` does not approve these tokens for the pool. Consequently, the transaction will revert when it attempts to burn and collect liquidity, making the entire _unfarmBuyBurn function ineffective.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Due to the missing approval, the _unfarmBuyBurn function will fail to execute. This prevents the protocol from removing liquidity from the pool.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To fix this issue, add an approval step for the liquidity tokens before calling the burnAndCollect function.
