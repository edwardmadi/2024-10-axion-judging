# AMO uses ERC20.approve instead of safe approvals, causing it to always revert on some ERC20s

### Summary

AMO uses ERC20.approve instead of safe approvals, causing it to always revert on some ERC20s. It will lead to DOS some function on AMO and AMO can't balance BOOST token.

### Root Cause

In `SolidlyV2AMO.sol` and `SolidlyV3AMO.sol`, in function `_unfarmBuyBurn` and `_addLiquidity` contract use ERC20.approve to approve `usd` token to router
```solidity
IERC20Upgradeable(usd).approve(router, usdAmount);
```

However, some known tokens don't return a value on approvals, more info [here](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20?tab=readme-ov-file#missing-return-values), an example of this is USDT, which is mentioned that the protocol will use it.

Standard ERC20s return a boolean on approval, https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol#L67.

USDT on the main net doesn't return a value, https://etherscan.io/token/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7#code.


### Internal pre-conditions

When init AMO, admin choose USDT as pegged usd coin.

### External pre-conditions

Null

### Attack Path

There are some case when AMO role call:
- `addLiquidity` function
- or `mintSellFarm` function
- or `unfarmBuyBurn` function
All this action will be revert and AMO can't balance BOOST token.

### Impact

When BOOST's price too high or too low, AMO will try to balance it using `mintSellFarm` or `unfarmBuyBurn`. This vulnerability will prevent AMO from balancing BOOST's price, DOS it's main feature.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Using `safeApprove` from Openzeppelin instead of `approve`
