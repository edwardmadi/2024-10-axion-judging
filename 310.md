# Contracts are not strictly ERC-1504-compliant

### Summary

`BoostStablecoin.sol`, `Minter.sol`, `SolidlyV2AMO`, `SolidlyV3AMO` is not following the ERC-1504 non-optional requirements-lacks Upgrader contract functions, leading to the creation of non-compatible-non-upgradable contracts. Developers always have to destruct the old contract, deploy a new one and potentially migrate the data (hard fork) to the new contract.

First of all, contracts are expected to be strictly ERC-1504-compliant as we can see that they have mentioned in [readme](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion?tab=readme-ov-file#q-is-the-codebase-expected-to-comply-with-any-eips-can-there-beare-there-any-deviations-from-the-specification). Also contracts are inheriting features of upgradeablity like ERC20BurnableUpgradeable, AccessControlEnumerableUpgradeable which also shows that protocol goal to follow ERC-1504 for Upgradable Contract.

It lacks key functionalities outlined in the [ERC-1504 specification](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1504#specification): In order to make a smart contract upgradable, ERC-1504 divide it into two parts:

- Data contract keeps the resources;
- Handler contract contains operations.
The Handler contract can be upgraded in the future while the Data contract is permanent. Handler contract can manipulate the variables in Data contract through the getter and setter functions provided by Data contract.

Example: In [`Minter.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/c65e662999d0c79439703fc6713814b4ad023e01/liquidity-amo/contracts/Minter.sol#L12) contract lacks Upgrader contract functions`startUpgrading`, `getProposalPeriod ()`, `setProposalPeriod`, `canBeUpgraded`, `live ()`.


### Root Cause
lacks of  Upgrader contract functions outlined in the [ERC-1504 specification](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1504#specification)


### Impact

Non-compliance with ERC-1504 
- the creation of non-compatible contracts means developers always have to destruct the old contract, deploy a new one and potentially migrate the data (hard fork) to the new contract. Definite material loss without (extensive) limitations of external conditions.

### Severity
- Likelihood: High - 100% is not compliant
- Impact: High - Definite material loss without (extensive) limitations of external conditions.
- Severity: High


### Mitigation

Follow all non-optional official [ERC-1504 specification](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1504#specification)
