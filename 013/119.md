# No callback functions implemented in SolidlyV3AMO

### Summary

The documentation at https://sticky-yarrow-52e.notion.site/AXION-Audit-Documentation-11bb3e443073802c949bd3700abad968 states that for V3 pools, the following pools will be supported

-   Aerodrome
-   Velodrome
-   Thena
-   Ramses

This is also hinted at by the files in the solidly-utils folder, with their names.

The issue is that for V3 pools, most of these protocols implement a callback mechanism in their pool contracts, which calls a function of the `msg.sender`.

For example, highlighting just the Aerodrome CL contract at https://basescan.org/address/0xeC8E5342B19977B4eF8892e02D8DAEcfa1315831#code,

The `swap` function:

```solidity
uint256 balance0Before = balance0();
ICLSwapCallback(msg.sender).uniswapV3SwapCallback(amount0, amount1, data);
require(balance0Before.add(uint256(amount0)) <= balance0(), "IIA");
```

`mint` function:

```solidity
if (amount0 > 0) balance0Before = balance0();
if (amount1 > 0) balance1Before = balance1();
ICLMintCallback(msg.sender).uniswapV3MintCallback(amount0, amount1, data);
if (amount0 > 0) require(balance0Before.add(amount0) <= balance0(), "M0");
if (amount1 > 0) require(balance1Before.add(amount1) <= balance1(), "M1");
```

This is also present in Thena, velodrome and Ramses contracts and can be checked individually.

Ramses at: https://arbiscan.io/address/0x6553aaee5a3a482a7d61bb5e093b05140fe17e21#code
Thena at: https://bscscan.com/address/0x51bd5e6d3da9064d59bcaa5a76776560ab42ceb8#code
Velodrome at: https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xc28aD28853A547556780BEBF7847628501A3bCbb#code

Due to the absence of the callback functions, the current contract wont work with any of these protocols.

### Root Cause

The current contracts were written for SolidlyV3, which doesnt implement callbacks. But the intention is to also support solidly forks like thena, ramses etc, which follow the uniV3 style of using callbacks. Thus there is an incompatibility.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

Incompatibility with the pools in question

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

Use the router instead of the pools directly. The router handles the callbacks for the pools.
