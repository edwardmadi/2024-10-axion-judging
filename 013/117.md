# Incorrect `swap` usage in `SolidlyV3AMO.sol`

### Summary

The documentation at https://sticky-yarrow-52e.notion.site/AXION-Audit-Documentation-11bb3e443073802c949bd3700abad968 states that for V3 pools, the following pools will be supported

-   Aerodrome
-   Velodrome
-   Thena
-   Ramses

This is also hinted at by the files in the soliudly-utils folder, with their names.

The issue is that the contract is actually not compatible with any of the above mentioned protocols.

The `SolidlyV3AMO.sol` contract calls the pool's `swap` function multiple times.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV3AMO.sol#L144-L151

The issue is that this only works for SolidlyV3 on fantom. For all other intended protocols, like Thena, ramses etc, they dont take the `minUsdAmountOut` and `deadline` parameters and only take a `bytes calldata data` instead.

Thena CL pool contract: https://bscscan.com/address/0x51bd5e6d3da9064d59bcaa5a76776560ab42ceb8#code
Ramses CL pool contract: https://arbiscan.io/address/0x6553aaee5a3a482a7d61bb5e093b05140fe17e21#code
Velodrome: https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xc28aD28853A547556780BEBF7847628501A3bCbb#code
Aerodrome: https://basescan.org/address/0xeC8E5342B19977B4eF8892e02D8DAEcfa1315831#code

In all the above linked contracts, the `swap` function is different as shown below.

```solidity
function swap(
        address recipient,
        bool zeroForOne,
        int256 amountSpecified,
        uint160 sqrtPriceLimitX96,
        bytes calldata data
    ) external override advancePeriod returns (int256 amount0, int256 amount1)
```

This is different from the SolidlyV3 contract on fantom, so the contracts here wont work with these protocols.

Since the devs mentioned clearly that they want to support these protocols, this is an issue.

### Root Cause

The main issue is that Ramses, Thena, velo and aerodrome contracts implement the `swap` function differently.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

Incompatibility with Ramses, Thena, Velodrome Aerodrome

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

Implement a different version of this contract which handles the `swap` function change for these supported protocols.
