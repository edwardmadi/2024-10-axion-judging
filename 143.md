# `SolidlyV3AMO::_unfarmBuyBurn` sets amountToCollect to type(uint128).max which is an ineffective slippage value

### Summary

In `SolidlyV3AMO` the `_unfarmBuyBurn` executes solidly's `_burnAndCollect()` but the `amount0ToCollect & amount1ToCollect` slippage is set to `type(uint128).max` which realistically offers no protections and will cause the checks to always pass

### Root Cause

In [`SolidlyV3AMO.sol:242-243`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV3AMO.sol#L242-L243) the `amount0ToCollect & amount1ToCollect` is set to type(uint128).max

### Internal pre-conditions

 `_unfarmBuyBurn` has to be called 

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

When it is called, watch the `amountCollected` always be the `position.tokensOwed` and never the amountToCollect

### Impact

The value collected will always be skewed to one side and that is from the position and never be the amountToCollect this is because the amountToCollect is soo big that the internal check in collect will always be true. 

### PoC

This is the function `burnAndCollect` interface.

```solidity
function burnAndCollect(address recipient, int24 tickLower, int24 tickUpper, uint128 amountToBurn, uint256 amount0FromBurnMin, uint256 amount1FromBurnMin, uint128 amount0ToCollect, uint128 amount1ToCollect, uint256 deadline
    )
        external override checkDeadline(deadline) returns 
```

From our `_unfarmBuyBurn` this is where we call `burnAndCollect` so comparing the two interfaces we can see that `amount0ToCollect & amount1ToCollect` are both type(uint128).max

```soldity
(
            uint256 amount0FromBurn,
            uint256 amount1FromBurn,
            uint128 amount0Collected,
            uint128 amount1Collected
        ) = ISolidlyV3Pool(pool).burnAndCollect(
                address(this),
                tickLower,
                tickUpper,
                uint128(liquidity),
                amount0Min,
                amount1Min,
                type(uint128).max,//@audit why max and not a real value
                type(uint128).max,//@audit
                deadline
            );
```

which when we look at the further implementation of [`burnAndCollect`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x70fe4a44ea505cfa3a57b95cf2862d4fd5f0f687#code#F33#L374)
we can tell that it makes a call to `collect` with `amount0ToCollect & amount1ToCollect`
Looking at  [`collect`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x70fe4a44ea505cfa3a57b95cf2862d4fd5f0f687#code#F33#L402) it makes an internal call to [`_collect`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x70fe4a44ea505cfa3a57b95cf2862d4fd5f0f687#code#F33#L412) which performs these validations

```solidity
Position.Info storage position = positions.get(msg.sender, tickLower, tickUpper);

        amount0 = amount0Requested > position.tokensOwed0 ? position.tokensOwed0 : amount0Requested;
        amount1 = amount1Requested > position.tokensOwed1 ? position.tokensOwed1 : amount1Requested;

```

in this case `amount0ToCollect` and `amount1ToCollect` is the same as `amount0Requested & amount1Requested`. So from the point i made earlier we can further confirm that the conditions will always be true thereby making the value always one sided that is from the position.

### Mitigation
Implement a better slippage logic
