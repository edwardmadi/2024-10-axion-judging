# Future versions of MasterAMO contract will cause a storage collision

### Summary

Adding new state variables in future versions of MasterAMO.sol will cause a storage collision with the state variables in child contracts (SolidlyV2AMO and SolidlyV3AMO), as MasterAMO has no gap with free slots for future implementations.

### Root Cause

When an implementation contract is used from a proxy contract, storage in proxy contract is modified by using the logic in implementation contract through ``` delegatecall()```, storage in implementation contract does not change. Each state variable will take the same storage slot as it would in the implementation contract, therefore it required that the storage layout is consistent between different implementation versions.

Problem will come whenever a new MasterAMO.sol version that contains new state variables is used. In fact, developers confirm that they will implement modifications in this contract: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/MasterAMO.sol#L16-L20

New state variables will alter the layout storage, making state variables in mentioned child contracts take different slots to what they used to and therefore leading to storage collision.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. SolidlyV2AMO or SolidlyV3AMO is deployed as first implementation version of the system.
2. Proxy contract that executes the logic of SolidlyV2AMO or SolidlyV3AMO is deployed.
3. ```initialize()``` function is used to set the initial variables in the proxy contract. Let's say that variables ```validRemovingRatio```, ```boostLowerPriceSell``` and ```boostUpperPriceBuy``` from MasterAMO.sol take slots 18, 19 and 20 of the storage respectively. Then, first state variables of SolidlyV2AMO will take following slots: ``` router```,  ```gauge``` and ```rewardVault``` will take slots 21, 22 and 23 respectively.
4. The contract is used under normal conditions for a unknown period of time. 

### External pre-conditions

1. Developer team decides to deploy a new implementation of MasterAMO.sol, which includes a new ```uint256 public governanceTimelock;``` state variable that shows the governance timelock. This variable is the last one in MasterAMO contract, so it will take the next slot to ```boostUpperPriceBuy```, which used to be the last variable of the contract. 
2. Now ```governanceTimelock``` is in slot 21 of this new implementation version. As a consequence, variables from SolidlyV2AMO will take the free slots, ``` router``` will take slot 22,  ```gauge```  will take slot 23 and ```rewardVault``` will take slots 24... Each variable will now take the next slot to what it used to in the previous version.


### Attack Path

1. IGauge(gauge).withdraw() is called via _unfarmBuyBurn() function. ```gauge``` address now is contained in slot 23, but this slot contains the address of ```rewardVault```, as the slot was previously taken by this variable, so the function reverts, leading to DoS because of storage collision.
2. Many other functions will revert, as they do not call the expected address. State variable values will be misused, as the proxy contract will be reading values that now belongs to other variables different to expected ones.

### Impact

Storage collision will cause DoS, reverting majority of function calls and getting wrong values from state variables, as a result of the displacement suffered in SolidlyV2AMO for the addition of a new state variable in MasterAMO.sol

### PoC

Manual review

### Mitigation

In the first implementation of MasterAMO, add an array of free gaps that will be reserved for new state variables that this contract may have in current implementations.
