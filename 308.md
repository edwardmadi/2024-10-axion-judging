# Boost Token Manipulation and Profit Extraction When BOOST is Overpegged

### Summary

The protocol’s design allows an attacker to exploit overpegged BOOST tokens to extract continuous profit. When BOOST is overpegged (trading above its intended value), an attacker can leverage the mintSellFarm() function to manipulate the price of BOOST and drain USD from the protocol. By cycling through deposits, withdrawals, and calls to mintSellFarm(), the attacker can repeatedly lower BOOST's price and profit from each cycle.

### Internal pre-conditions

Overpegged BOOST Token

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Deposit and Withdraw: The attacker deposits USD into the pool and withdraws BOOST tokens while the BOOST price is overpegged.
2. Invoke mintSellFarm(): The attacker calls mintSellFarm(), triggering a minting and selling operation that decreases the BOOST price.
3. Repeat Cycle: After BOOST’s price is driven down, the attacker can deposit additional BOOST tokens and withdraw more USD than initially invested. The attacker can repeat this cycle whenever BOOST is overpegged to extract profits.

### Impact

Continuous Draining of Protocol Funds
