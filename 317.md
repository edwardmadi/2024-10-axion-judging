# Determining the BOOST amount using an on-chain `quoteSwap` call is unreliable

### Summary

Using `quoteSwap` to calculate how much BOOST can be swapped for USD in a transaction is a poor strategy because a malicious user could manipulate the in/out amounts in the pool, or even a non-malicious user could cause issues simply by executing a transaction before yours.

### Root Cause

In [SolidlyV3AMO.sol#L298](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV3AMO.sol#L298) there is a `quoteSwap`.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A user (who may not even be malicious) could alter the in/out amounts in the pool.
2. The `mintSellFarm` call will interact with the already altered amounts in the pool and ultimately set a new BOOST price.

### Impact

Malicious user can influence the price of BOOST

### Mitigation

Consider avoiding the use of on-chain `quoteSwap` to determine the BOOST amount
