# `MasterAMO#withdrawERC20()` is allowed to withdraw ERC20 to any account.


### Summary

According to the contest README, ERC withdrawls should only be transferred to the multisig address. However, this is not the case for AMO contracts.

> any critical permission is given to the multisig —— note that any ERC withdrawals are only to the multisig adress

### Root Cause

Users with the `WITHDRAWER_ROLE` role is free to withdraw ERC20 tokens from AMO contract to any recipient, which contradicts the README.

```solidity
    function withdrawERC20(
        address token,
        uint256 amount,
        address recipient
    ) external override onlyRole(WITHDRAWER_ROLE) {
        if (recipient == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
        IERC20Upgradeable(token).safeTransfer(recipient, amount);
    }
```
