# Protocol is not complient with ERC1504

### Summary

The protocol is required to strictly comply with ERC-1504 standards, which define a structure for modular upgradeable contracts. However, the protocol fails to implement this structure as it lacks a required "Handler" contract, resulting in non-compliance.

### Root Cause

Protocol should be consist of:  
1. Handler contract (implements Handler interface) defines operations and provides services. This contract can be upgraded;
2. Data contract keeps the resources (data) and is controlled by the Handler contract;
3. Upgrader contract (optional) deals with the voting mechanism and upgrades the Handler contract. The voters are pre-defined by the contract owner.

The protocol does not include a Handler contract, which is essential for defining operations and providing services as per the ERC-1504 specifications.
