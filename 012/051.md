# Lack of input validation on setParams can brick peg functions

### Summary

Lack of input validation on setParams can brick peg functions, such as mintFarmSell, unfarmBuyBurn and others. 

This would normally not be in-scope by the [rules](https://github.com/sherlock-protocol/sherlock-v2-docs/blob/b6baeead88b864c9aadc2430af5db0cbd3f38bf6/audits/judging/judging/README.md)


> (External) Admin trust assumptions: When a function is access restricted, only values for specific function variables mentioned in the README can be taken into account when identifying an attack path.
> 
> If no values are provided, the (external) admin is trusted to use values that will not cause any issues.


but the readme says:

> Are there any limitations on values set by admins (or other roles) in the codebase, including restrictions on array lengths?
> 
> No, there are no off-chain limitations!
> There are, however, some hard-coded limitations —— mainly to ensure that even admins can only buyback BOOST below peg and sell it above peg. These are doctsringed.


and the [code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV2AMO.sol#L127-L128) attempts to do validation: 

```solidity
        if (validRangeWidth_ > FACTOR || validRemovingRatio_ < FACTOR) revert InvalidRatioValue(); // validRangeWidth is a few percentage points (scaled with factor). So it needs to be lower than 1 (scaled with FACTOR)
        // validRemovingRatio nedds to be greater than 1 (we remove more BOOST than USD otherwise the pool is balanced )
```

so this is in-scope because it is explicitly stated there are no limitations off-chain and attempts are made to prevent it in code.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV2AMO.sol#L127-L135
```solidity
    function setParams(
        uint256 boostMultiplier_,
        uint24 validRangeWidth_,
        uint24 validRemovingRatio_,
        uint256 boostLowerPriceSell_,
        uint256 boostUpperPriceBuy_,
        uint256 boostSellRatio_,
        uint256 usdBuyRatio_
    ) public override onlyRole(SETTER_ROLE) {
        if (validRangeWidth_ > FACTOR || validRemovingRatio_ < FACTOR) revert InvalidRatioValue(); // validRangeWidth is a few percentage points (scaled with factor). So it needs to be lower than 1 (scaled with FACTOR)
        // validRemovingRatio nedds to be greater than 1 (we remove more BOOST than USD otherwise the pool is balanced )
        boostMultiplier = boostMultiplier_;
        validRangeWidth = validRangeWidth_;
        validRemovingRatio = validRemovingRatio_;
        boostLowerPriceSell = boostLowerPriceSell_;
        boostUpperPriceBuy = boostUpperPriceBuy_;
        boostSellRatio = boostSellRatio_;
        usdBuyRatio = usdBuyRatio_;
```

Here only validRangeWidth and validRemovingRatio are checked for validity. However, the other parameters also need checking for validity. For instance, boostSellRatio/usdBuyRatio must be checked as they are used for mintSellFarm and unfarmBuyBurn:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV2AMO.sol#L345-L353
```solidity
        uint256 boostAmountIn = (((usdReserve - boostReserve) / 2) * boostSellRatio) / FACTOR;

        (, , , , liquidity) = _mintSellFarm(
            boostAmountIn,
            toUsdAmount(boostAmountIn), // minUsdAmountOut
            1, // minBoostSpend
            1, // minUsdSpend
            block.timestamp + 1 // deadline
        );
```

If boostSellRatio >> FACTOR, such as FACTOR * 10^3 for example, mintSellFarm will never be possible and revert unless there is a 1e3 factor depeg because it will attempt to sell too much boost and will never get the required amount of usd. If it is too low such as 1 wei then it will have almost no effect when called and waste a huge amount of gas trying to repeg when called multiple times. It should be limited to something such as range [FACTOR * 1e-4, FACTOR * 1e-1].

Similar in unfarmBuyBurn:
```solidity
        uint256 usdNeeded = (((boostReserve - usdReserve) / 2) * usdBuyRatio) / FACTOR;
```

Similar for validRemovingRatio in the parameterized _unfarmBuyBurn:
```solidity
        if ((boostRemoved * validRemovingRatio) / FACTOR < toBoostAmount(usdRemoved))
            revert InvalidRatioToRemoveLiquidity();
```

and so on for the other parameters.

The same issue exists in V3 AMO: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV3AMO.sol#L108-L118

### Internal pre-conditions

Admin sets boostSellRatio/usdBuyRatio/other parameters to invalid values on creation. For example, boostSellRatio to FACTOR * 1e3.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Not an attack

### Impact

The contracts lose pegging functionality as functions like the parameterized _unfarmBuyBurn will always revert if parameters are set improperly. The admin also cannot repeg if 1 boost << 1 usd. This should be high as depegging would cause loss > 1% to users. The contract is not broken immediately but this may only be noticed after some time has passed when the peg functions actually need to be called.

### PoC

Not required according to the terms.

### Mitigation

Put appropriate checks for the parameters. For example, boostSellRatio in range [FACTOR * 1e-4, FACTOR * 1e-1].
