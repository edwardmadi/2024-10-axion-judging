# Public resale functions can b sandwiched for profit

### Summary

The system has 2 public sale functions, the `mintSellFarm` and `unfarmBuyBurn`. These can be called by anyone and can be used to buy or sell boost tokens depending on whether the token price is above or below peg.

The issue is that any user can sandwich this transaction and make a profit.

While these public functions are most exploitable, MEV searchers can also sandwicht he admin controlled mint/burn functions for profit.

Such a profit scenario is described below. The calculations are done for V2 pools, since its easier.

Say a v2 pool exists with 10000 boost and 9000 usd. thus boost price = 0.9. So the unfarmbuyburn function will be called to raise the price.

1. LP comp = 10000 boost, 9000 usd, p = 0.9

Alice comes in first and buys up some boost tokens. She swaps 247 usd for 267 boost tokens.

2. LP comp = 9733 boost, 9247 usd, p=0.95

Alice then triggers `_unfarmBuyBurn`.
`usdNeeded` = (9733 - 9247)/2 = 243
`liquidity` = 243/9247 = 2.63%
Assume the AMO has 2.63% of the total liquidity under its control. So it will first trigger a burn of 2.63% of the liquidity. LP comp will thus decrease.
AMO takes out 2.63% liquidity, which is 256 boost and 243 usd tokens. Since boost>usd, all checks pass.

3. LP Comp = 9477 boost, 9004 usd, p=0.95

AMO then uses its 243 usd to buy up 249 boost tokens.

4. LP Comp = 9228 boost, 9247 usd, p=1.002

AMO then burns up 249+256=505 boost tokens.
Alice then sells her 267 boost tokens for 260 usd.

5. LP comp = 9495 boost, 8987 usd, p=0.946

Alice initially had invested 247 usd, and made back 260 usd, profiting 13 usd.
Price at the end is 0.946, so `unfarmBuyBurn` can be called again.

This demonstrates a way for any user to profit from the buyback. Similarly, users can also sell and buyback boost tokens sandwiching a `mintSellFarm` call.

No checks prevent this sequence of steps. Mainly because in the `_unfarmBuyBurn` call, the contract puts the constraint that `usdNeeded` amount of boost tokens must be obtained from the buyback. Since the AMO got 249 boost tokens, which is higher then `usdNeeded` of 243, this transaction goes through.

```solidity
_unfarmBuyBurn(
            liquidity,
            (liquidity * boostReserve) / totalLp, // the minBoostRemove argument
            toUsdAmount(usdNeeded), // the minUsdRemove argument
            //@issue MEV opportunities
            usdNeeded, // the minBoostAmountOut argument
            block.timestamp + 1 // deadline is next block as the computation is valid instantly
        );
```

In the snippet above, the second last parameter ensures that the contract expects only a 1:1 swap ratio, even though the contract knows its depgged. This allows Alice to come in and sandwich for profit, at the expense of the AMO.

### Root Cause

The main cause is that the AMO can be made to do a public buy by anyone. So anyone who buys before the AMO and then sells can profit.

### Internal pre-conditions

Price above/below peg, so that the buy/sell can be trigerred.

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

Described above stepwise.

### Impact

Alice (attacker) is able to profit from the pool. The final price is also not 1.00 but 0.946, meaning the token is still depegged even though the AMO has used up their liquidity. Alice not only profited, but did so at the expense of the peg stabilization algorithm.

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

This is a design issue. Instead of a public function with loose slippage as shown here, use admin functions with stricter slippage. This will prevent sandwich attempts. Consider disabling the public functions, or re-think the MEV angle.
