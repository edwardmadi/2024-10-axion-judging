# Wrong `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` given to factory deployer leads to Minter contract being unmanageable

### Summary

Incorrect role assignment in `Minter.initialize()` grants `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` instead of `ADMIN_ROLE` to the factory deployer. This leads to permanent loss of administrative control, rendering the Minter contract unmanageable and breaking core protocol functionalities.

### Root Cause

In [`Minter.initialize()`, the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is granted](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/c65e662999d0c79439703fc6713814b4ad023e01/liquidity-amo/contracts/Minter.sol#L44) to the deployer (`msg.sender`) instead of the [`ADMIN_ROLE`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/Minter.sol#L25):

This is critical because:
1. Other functions in the contract require the `ADMIN_ROLE`: [setTokens()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/c65e662999d0c79439703fc6713814b4ad023e01/liquidity-amo/contracts/Minter.sol#L62), [setTreasury()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/c65e662999d0c79439703fc6713814b4ad023e01/liquidity-amo/contracts/Minter.sol#L71)
2. The deployer is a factory contract that might not have a function to call `AccessControlUpgradeable.grantRole()`.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The Minter contract is deployed by a factory contract.
2. The Minter contract is initialized, granting `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` to the factory.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The factory contract deploys and initializes the Minter contract.
2. The factory receives the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, but not the required `ADMIN_ROLE`.
3. The factory lacks functionality to call `grantRole()` to assign the `ADMIN_ROLE`.
4. Any attempt to call `setTokens()`, `setTreasury()` fails.
5. The contract becomes permanently unmanageable.

### Impact

Complete loss of administrative control over the Minter contract, breaking core contract functionality.
