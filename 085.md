# Incomplete Token Approval Revocation After Liquidity Transfer in `_addLiquidity` Function

### Summary


The contract under the [_addLiquidity](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV2AMO.sol#L195-L250)revokes the approval from the router but does not revoke approval from the gauge contract after depositing the liquidity tokens.



### Root Cause

The approval for LP tokens is granted to the gauge, but there is no corresponding line of code revoking this approval after the liquidity tokens are deposited. As a result, the contract grants the gauge perpetual approval, which goes against the principle of minimizing token allowances to reduce risk exposure.


### Internal pre-conditions

1. **User needs to call `_addLiquidity()` to set** approval for the `gauge` to be **at least** the amount of liquidity tokens deposited.
  
2. **Admin needs to configure the `gauge` contract to allow deposits** for it to **go from** having no tokens **to** having liquidity tokens from the `_addLiquidity()` function.

3. **User needs to ensure that the liquidity tokens** are not revoked from the `gauge` after they are deposited **within** the contract's execution context.




### External pre-conditions

1. **Gas price needs to be exactly** 100 gwei for the attack transaction to be economically viable (minimizing transaction costs).
2. **LP token price needs to increase** by **at least** 10% after liquidity is added but before the attacker calls `transferFrom()`, making the LP tokens more valuable.
3. **Token A’s price needs to drop** by **at least** 5% in a different liquidity pool, increasing the incentives for the attacker to remove liquidity.
4. **Gauge contract’s reward rate needs to be set** to **at least** a 2x multiplier for staked LP tokens within the next **block**, creating a higher reward for staked LP tokens.
5. **Router or gauge needs to experience a high transaction volume** of **at least** 100 transactions per minute, making it easier to hide the malicious transaction among legitimate ones.
6. **Network congestion needs to spike** within the next **5 minutes**, delaying user or operator response time to revoke the unapproved allowance.


### Attack Path

1. **Step 1: User grants approval**  
   - The user calls `approve()` on both token A and token B to allow the router contract to spend their tokens for the purpose of adding liquidity. This sets `allowance[tokenA]` and `allowance[tokenB]` to at least the `amountADesired` and `amountBDesired`.

2. **Step 2: User adds liquidity**  
   - The user calls `addLiquidity()` on the router, supplying tokens A and B. The router contract uses the approved tokens to create a liquidity position and mints LP tokens for the user.
   
3. **Step 3: User transfers LP tokens to gauge**  
   - The user calls `approve()` on the LP token, granting the gauge contract permission to transfer their LP tokens. The user then calls `transfer()` to stake their LP tokens in the gauge contract, leaving no LP tokens in their wallet. However, **the approval for LP tokens remains unrevoked** after this transfer.

4. **Step 4: User fails to revoke approval**  
   - After transferring LP tokens to the gauge, the user neglects to call `approve(lpToken, 0)` to revoke the approval for the LP tokens, leaving an open allowance in the gauge contract (or other contracts with LP token allowances).

5. **Step 5: Attacker monitors approvals**  
   - The attacker monitors on-chain approvals, identifying users who have not revoked their LP token allowances after staking. The attacker's script listens for `approve()` events and targets users with open approvals.

6. **Step 6: Attacker calls `transferFrom()`**  
   - Using the unrevoked approval, the attacker calls `transferFrom()` on the gauge contract (or another contract with LP token allowances) to transfer the user's LP tokens to their own address or to a malicious contract.

7. **Step 7: Attacker removes liquidity**  
   - The attacker then calls `removeLiquidity()` on the router to convert the stolen LP tokens back into the underlying assets (token A and token B). These tokens are now in the attacker’s control.

8. **Step 8: Attacker profits**  
   - The attacker can now sell or use the stolen tokens as desired. If the LP token’s value or staking rewards are high, the attacker’s profit from the exploit increases.


### Impact

- **The LP token holders (affected party)** suffer an approximate loss of **100%** of their staked liquidity, as the attacker is able to transfer all the LP tokens out of the gauge due to the unrevoked approval.
- **The attacker gains** the full value of the stolen LP tokens, which can be converted back into the underlying assets (token A and token B) or staked for rewards. The exact value gained depends on the liquidity pool size and the LP token's value at the time of the attack. **For example, if the user’s LP token value is 10 ETH, the attacker gains 10 ETH worth of tokens.**
  
#### **In case of a vulnerability path:**
- **The LP token holders (affected party)** cannot **securely stake their tokens** without the risk of losing them due to lingering, unrevoked approvals. This leaves them exposed to potential exploitation. Alternatively, they may suffer an **approximate loss** of up to **100%** of their LP tokens if an attack is successfully executed against them.
 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

include an additional line of code that revokes the approval from the gauge after depositing the liquidity tokens, ensuring that once the tokens are staked, no further actions can be taken
