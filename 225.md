# Comparing a large but close value of boost with usd will cause unfarming to revert

### Summary

This report identifies a vulnerability in the process of comparing Boostout and USDin . The issue arises from converting Boost amounts  into  USD amounts with varying decimals (like USDC or USDT) , which causes precision loss. This precision loss can lead to incorrect balance comparisons, causing legitimate transactions to revert unexpectedly.

### Root Cause

In the contract, Boost token balances are compared to USD token balances to determine whether unfarming operations should proceed. The contract supports multiple USD tokens, such as USDC and USDT, which may have varying decimal places (6-18 decimals). The current implementation scales these USD balances to match Boostâ€™s decimals but introduces precision loss when converting a higher-decimal token (Boost) down to a lower-decimal token (USD). 

The following code introduces this precision loss:

```solidity
               function toUsdAmount(uint256 boostAmount) internal view returns (uint256) {
@audit>> 1. >>          return boostAmount / 10 ** (boostDecimals - usdDecimals);
    }

```

```solidity
 // Ensure the BOOST output is sufficient relative to the USD input
@audit>> 2. >>            if (toUsdAmount(boostAmountOut) <= usdAmountIn)
            revert InsufficientOutputAmount({outputAmount: toUsdAmount(boostAmountOut), minRequired: usdAmountIn});
        // Check the USD usage ratio to ensure it is within limits
```

Since Boost balances are converted down to match the smaller decimals of USD tokens, rounding errors or precision losses of up to `10**12` can occur. This makes it possible for the Boost balance to seem incorrectly equal to the USD balance, triggering a reversal when it should pass.

### Example Scenario:
- If Boost has 18 decimals and USDC has 6 decimals, the conversion can result in the Boost balance being inaccurately compared due to precision loss.
- The contract incorrectly detects that the Boost balance is lower or equal to the USD balance, which triggers a revert.

### Impact

The precision loss in the conversion process creates several issues:
- **Unnecessary reverts**: The contract could revert legitimate transactions because of the inaccurate comparison between Boost and USD balances.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- **Preserves precision**: By comparing both Boost and USD in terms of Boost amounts, the calculation avoids precision loss caused by converting between different decimal token formats.

both Boost and USD should be compared in terms of their respective native units (Boost amounts). This avoids the need for cross-token conversion, preventing precision errors.

### Corrected Code Example:



```solidity


--        if (toUsdAmount(boostAmountOut) <= usdAmountIn)
--            revert InsufficientOutputAmount({outputAmount: toUsdAmount(boostAmountOut), minRequired: usdAmountIn});
  

  // Ensure the BOOST output is sufficient relative to the USD input
++        if (boostAmountOut <= toBoostAmount (usdAmountIn))
++            revert InsufficientOutputAmount({outputAmount: boostAmountOut, minRequired:  toBoostAmount(usdAmountIn)});
        // Check the USD usage ratio to ensure it is within limits
```
