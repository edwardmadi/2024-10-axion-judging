# Improper decimal handling in the Minter contract

### Summary

Improper decimal handling may cause transaction reverts and precision loss in collateral transfers.
The Minter contract involves the minting of BoostStablecoin tokens in exchange for collateral, with the following transfer mechanism:

This incorrect decimal handling could lead to reverts, failed mint operations, and precision loss, which would directly affect the core functionality of the Minter contract.

### Root Cause

If boostDecimals < collateralDecimals, mint() will revert.

### Internal pre-conditions

Admin sets collateral and boostAddress in the contract with mismatched decimals (collateralDecimals > boostDecimals).

### Impact

The users cannot mint tokens due to the transaction reverting whenever boostDecimals < collateralDecimals. This will prevent all future mint operations and halt protocol functionality under these conditions.

### Mitigation

Adding the following require() statement in the initialize() function would mitigate this issue by preventing contracts from being deployed with incompatible token decimal configurations:
```require(boostDecimals >= collateralDecimals, "Invalid");```
