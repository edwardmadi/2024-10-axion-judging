# Missing whenNotPaused Modifier in Critical Functions .

### **Summary**
The **mint** and **withdrawToken** functions in the protocol lack the **whenNotPaused** modifier. This omission can potentially allow critical actions, such as minting tokens and withdrawing assets, to occur during emergency protocol pauses. This vulnerability exposes the protocol to potential abuse during system malfunctions or while emergency maintenance is being conducted.
### **Vulnerability Details**
**mint** and **withdrawToken** both functions lack the **whenNotPaused** modifier. The mint function allows token creation, and the withdrawToken function enables asset withdrawal without restrictions when the protocol is paused.

### **Impact**
An authorized entity could mint tokens or withdraw assets even when the protocol is paused, potentially undermining the emergency mechanisms and allowing the draining of funds or inflation of the token supply.
### **Tools Used**
 Manual Review
### **Recommendation**
**Implement whenNotPaused Modifier:** Add the whenNotPaused modifier to both the mint and withdrawToken functions to ensure that these actions cannot be executed when the protocol is paused.
``` solidity
 --    function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public onlyRole(MINTER_ROLE)  {
++  function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public onlyRole(MINTER_ROLE) whenNotPaused {
       _mint(to, amount);
        }
 --   function withdrawToken(address token, uint256 amount) external onlyRole(WITHDRAWER_ROLE) {
++  function withdrawToken(address token, uint256 amount) external onlyRole(WITHDRAWER_ROLE) whenNotPaused {
       IERC20Upgradeable(token).safeTransfer(treasury, amount);
       emit TokenWithdrawn(token, amount);
       }
```
