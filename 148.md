# compromised/admin can rug users

### Summary

The protocol admin or a compromised admin can transfer all the tokens from the MasterAMO contract .

### Root Cause

Before the deploying of  the `MasterAMO` contract , it is  initialized with a set of  parameters , one which is the granting of `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE ` to an admin.

The  `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE `   when granted to an address ,   has the ability to grant and revoke any role as seen on  [L116](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/MasterAMO.sol#L116) of the  `MasterAMO` contract.

Any address granted the `WITHDRAWER_ROLE`  has the ability to transfer tokens from the contract  to any arbitrary address . This is done by calling  function [withdrawERC20()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/MasterAMO.sol#L312)  which is only  callable by  any address granted  the  `WITHDRAWER_ROLE` .

 
 
 This is problematic because if the admin is compromised or malicious , they have the ability to transfer every token from the contract  to an arbitrary address.

### PoC

```solidity
    function withdrawERC20(
        address token,
        uint256 amount,
        address recipient
    ) external override onlyRole(WITHDRAWER_ROLE) {
    if (recipient == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
  @>        IERC20Upgradeable(token).safeTransfer(recipient, amount);
    }
```

### Mitigation

Withdrawals should be restricted to a multisig wallet
