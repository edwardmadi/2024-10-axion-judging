# Use the same parameter strategy (setTokenId -> useTokenId + TokenID) in SolidlyV3 as in SolidlyV2 to cater for different Dex implementations

### Summary

In [SolidlyV2AMO.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV2AMO.sol), the contract accounts for various V2 Dexes by including a flexible setTokenId mechanism, which allows for staking LP tokens in a Gauge or managing Dexes that don't require staking. This is especially important as different implementations may need staking or different fee-claiming mechanisms.

In [SolidlyV3AMO.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV3AMO.sol), a similar strategy should be adopted to handle the two main types of V3 Dexes:

* Dexes that require NFT staking (like Aerodrome, Velodrome)
* Dexes where fees are claimed separately (like Algebra Dexes)

### Root Cause

Inconsistent implementation across SolidlyV2 and SolidlyV3 contracts in handling token IDs and staking mechanisms.



### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

* Inability to stake and claim fees in SolidlyV3 for certain Dex implementations.
* Increased need for an additional audit for each new implementation, even though the variations are standard and can be supported by a unified strategy now.
* If the current strategy is kept, integrating new Dexes or versions will likely require additional audit expenses. Assuming 2-3 Dex integrations per year,dditional audit costs will exceed $30k per year



### PoC

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV2AMO.sol#L240C1-L245C1

Can be replicated in V3 for staking and claiming

### Mitigation

Implement the same flexible parameter strategy (useTokenId and TokenId) in SolidlyV3AMO to support both types of Dexes from the start. This ensures the ability to stake NFTs where needed and claim fees separately in Dexes that donâ€™t require staking, avoiding future compatibility issues and additional audits.
