# Inaccessible Whitelist Management Function in the `SolidlyV2AMO.sol` Contract

### Summary

The permanent inaccessibility of the `SolidlyV2Amo.sol::setWhitelistedTokens` function will limit the protocol's ability to adapt. This will prevent administrators from updating the approved reward tokens

### Root Cause

In SolidlyV2AMO.sol, the SETTER_ROLE is revoked in the initialize function after initial setup, and there's no mechanism to reassign this role. The setWhitelistedTokens function, which requires the SETTER_ROLE, becomes permanently inaccessible.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. SolidlyV2AMO contract needs to be deployed and initialized.
2. The initialize function revokes the SETTER_ROLE from the msg.sender.
3. No function exists to reassign the SETTER_ROLE after initialization.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The contract is deployed and initialized.  
2. The SETTER_ROLE is automatically revoked from the deployer.  
3. Attempts to call setWhitelistedTokens will revert due to lacking SETTER_ROLE.  
4. The contract cannot add any whitelisted tokens.

### Impact

The protocol cannot add any whitelisted tokens including (FOT).

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Add the setWhitelistedTokens functionality directly within the initialize function, setting up the initial whitelist during contract deployment.
Alternately, you can assign a different role to this function to make it accessible.
