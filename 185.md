# Malicious sandwichers can make profit by sandwiching publix `unfarmBuyBurn` or `mintSellFarm` calls

### Summary

Currently, both the public `mintSellFarm()` and `unfarmBuyBurn()` are subject to a vulnerability where for example the attacker can:

1. Buy BOOST with the Stablecoin
2. Call unfarmBuyBurn() or wait for a call to unfarmBuyBurn() 
3. Sell BOOST and make a profit

There is one kind-of slippage check:

`if (newBoostPrice > boostUpperPriceBuy) revert PriceNotInRange(newBoostPrice);`

But this is insufficient because it compares price to an absolute value rather than a percentage, so in the event that BOOST price in the previous example is really low, attacker will still be able to make decent profit with the sandwich. 

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/MasterAMO.sol#L306

The "slippage" check `if (newBoostPrice > boostUpperPriceBuy) revert PriceNotInRange(newBoostPrice);` is insufficient


### Internal pre-conditions

No mandatory pre-conditions, but if `boostUpperPriceBuy` is too low it will be harder for attacker to make profit, albeit still possible

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Buy BOOST with the Stablecoin
2. Call unfarmBuyBurn() or wait for a call to unfarmBuyBurn() 
3. Sell BOOST and make a profit

Attacking `mintSellFarm` would work similarly

### Impact

Protocol suffers loss of funds, as for example some amount of the withdrawn liquidity for unfarmBuyBurn() goes to attacker
