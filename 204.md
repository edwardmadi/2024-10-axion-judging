# `mintSellFarm` underpredicts swap amount when boost price is above peg

### Summary

The `mintSellFarm` function mints boost tokens, sells it for usd and then adds liquidity in the pool. For the V3 AMO contract, this is done in a way which frequently underpredicts the amount that needs to be swapped.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV3AMO.sol#L295-L302

The way it estimates the amount to swap, is by first estimating a `maxBoostAmount`, which is the maximum amount it is willing to sell. The issue is that it does this by checking the reserves.

```solidity
uint256 maxBoostAmount = IERC20Upgradeable(boost).balanceOf(pool);
```

In concentrated liquidity pools, if the price is above peg, then most of the tokens in the pool will be converted into usd. So there will be very little boost in the pool, mostly from liquidity providers who supplied liquidity at even higher prices. As a result, the `maxBoostAmount` will be very low, and can be insufficient to restore the peg.

So the contract tries to estimate the mint amount using the current reserves, and the current reserves of boost will be very low since the price is above peg. So this function wont be able to restore the peg in a lot of cases.

Say a V3 pool has the price of 1.2. So most of its constituents will be usd. Say it has 10000 usd and 1000 boost only, since the price is above peg, which is where the main liquidity exists. In V3 pools the constituents alone do not reflect the pool price. Now if `mintSellFarm` is called, it will try to mint and sell 1000 boost only, which is likely insufficient since its very low compared to the usd reserves. So the peg wont be restored.

### Root Cause

The main reason is that boost mint amount is estimated from the current amount of boost in the pool. However, since the priec is above peg, there will be very few boost in the pool anyways, leading to underestimation of the swap and mint amounts.

### Internal pre-conditions

Boost has to be depegged above peg

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

Price wont be pegged by `mintSellFarm` due to the underestimation of the swap params.

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

Start `maxBoostAmount` with a large number, instead of the current boost reserves.
