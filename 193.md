# `SolidlyV2AMO` may have some problems with gauge implementation

### Summary

in the [`SolidlyV2AMO::_addLiquidity`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/SolidlyV2AMO.sol#L195-L250) function, we see the following block of code:
```javascript
        if (useTokenId) {
            IGauge(gauge).deposit(liquidity, tokenId);
        } else {
            IGauge(gauge).deposit(liquidity);
        }
```
As seen in the code, we have two types of deposit, one with `tokenId`(ERC721) and one with only a `liquidity` amount as a deposit input. Here a arrises a problem, because when taking a look in both the gauges implementations, we see that the [V3Gauge](https://ftmscan.com/address/0x8Be06359938C5ea92314E0323a5e9AB4cc4d0F19#code), support the deposit with `tokenId` and the [V2Gauge](https://ftmscan.com/address/0x15Cd14815AA171e166d312f2C211e6A2e6A12dCd#code) supports the deposits with just liquidity amount. This is an issue, because the `SolidlyV2AMO` contract doesn't implement a function to change the gauge address, meaning that if for example the contract started with `tokenId` deposit, it will be impossible to go the other way around and change the type of deposit, even though the protocol have this intend by changing the `useTokenId` variable.

### Root Cause

Root cause of the issue is that V3Gauge support only `tokenId` deposits, while V2Gauge supports only `liquidity` amount deposits

### Internal pre-conditions

Protocol is deployed with for example V2Gauge as a staring gauge, meaning that if the `useTokenId` variable is changed to true the protocol won't be able to deposit with `tokenId` since the V2Gauge doesn't support it

### External pre-conditions

V3Gauge support only `tokenId` deposits, while V2Gauge supports only `liquidity` amount deposits

### Attack Path

none

### Impact

The protocol won't be able to change the deposit ways if needed

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

implement a `setGauge` function
