# `SolidlyV3AMO.sol`:`_addLiquidity` prevent adding liquidity when spot price is off

### Summary

The system allows addition of liquidity around the peg price. This is done via the `_addLiquidity` function.

For V2AMO, the contract needs to make sure that the liquidity is being added at the correct price. To ensure this, the spot price of the market is checked using the `boostPrice` function.

But for V3 pools, this is unnecessary, since in V3 the exact price for liquidity addition can be chosen. So even if the spot price is very high or very low, liquidity can still be added at the peg price. The V3 contracts have a defined `tickLower` and `tickUpper` for this purpose.

The issue is that the V3 contracts have another check further down, based on the liquidity constituents.

The constraint at the end in the snippet above ensure that the boost and usd amounts being added must be done at nearly equal ratios. However, if the spot price is higher/lower than the peg, then V3 will add single sided liquidity, which will cause this check to revert.

So users will be unable to add liquidity around the peg if the spot price is off, even though it should not matter for V3 liquidity addition. This will cause the `_addliquidity` function to revert even when functionality should not be affected.

### Root Cause

The main reason is that the contracts check to make sure the components of liquidity addition are close to each other, even though in V3 liquidity can be added at any price point.

### Mitigation

Consider removing the liquidity components check from the V3 function
