# Rounding  error in Time-Based Calculations in `MasterUtils.sol`

### Summary

The rounding down of time calculations will cause potential rounding errors for time-sensitive operations, as transactions near week boundaries may be incorrectly assigned to the previous week, leading to delayed or missed actions.

### Root Cause

    - The `block.timestamp` represents the current time in seconds (the number of seconds since the Unix epoch).
    - Dividing `block.timestamp` by `1 weeks` gives the number of full weeks since the Unix epoch (this is integer division, so any remainder is discarded).
    - Multiplying the result by `1 weeks` rounds the timestamp down to the start of the current week.
  
This is meant to align `activePeriod` with the beginning of a week, so certain contract actions can be performed based on weekly intervals.

### Attack Path

imagine `block.timestamp` is **one second** before the start of a new week. For instance:
      - Letâ€™s say `block.timestamp = 1,209,599` seconds (2 weeks minus 1 second).
      - Dividing this by `1 week` gives:
        `
        1,209,599 / 604,800 = 1
        `
      - Multiplying back by `1 week` results in:
        `
        1 * 604,800 = 604,800
        `
      - This rounds the timestamp down to the **previous week**, even though we're almost in the next week.

### Impact

the contract would still consider the current time as part of the **previous** week, even though we're extremely close to the next week.
