# In SolidlyV3AMO `unfarmBuyBurn()`, not all retrieved USD are used for swap.


### Summary

In SolidlyV3AMO `unfarmBuyBurn()` function, liquidity is burned in the beginning, and USD is collected from the pool. However, the current implementation doesn't use up all retrieved USD, which is a lack of use of funds.

### Root Cause

We can check an implementation of SolidlyV3: https://vscode.blockscan.com/fantom/0x8Ea5cE4272718360112330bfFf967bF51c378cDE

```solidity
    /// @notice Convenience method to burn liquidity and then collect owed tokens in one go
    /// @param recipient The address which should receive the tokens collected
    /// @param tickLower The lower tick of the position for which to collect tokens
    /// @param tickUpper The upper tick of the position for which to collect tokens
    /// @param amountToBurn How much liquidity to burn
    /// @param amount0ToCollect How much token0 should be withdrawn from the tokens owed
    /// @param amount1ToCollect How much token1 should be withdrawn from the tokens owed
@>  /// @return amount0FromBurn The amount of token0 accrued to the position from the burn
@>  /// @return amount1FromBurn The amount of token1 accrued to the position from the burn
@>  /// @return amount0Collected The amount of token0 collected from the positions
@>  /// @return amount1Collected The amount of token1 collected from the positions
    function burnAndCollect(
        address recipient,
        int24 tickLower,
        int24 tickUpper,
        uint128 amountToBurn,
        uint128 amount0ToCollect,
        uint128 amount1ToCollect
   )
```

The difference between `amount0ToBurn` and `amount1ToCollect` is that, the former is the amount of tokens corresponding to the burned liquidity, but the latter is the total amount of tokens received, and it may also include LP fees and dangling tokens that are not collected yet.

The issue here is, after calling `burnAndCollect`, `amount0ToCollect`/`amount1ToCollect` is the amount of token received, but when performing USD -> Boost swap, `amount0ToBurn`/`amount1ToBurn` is used instead. This may cause the not all USD tokens to be used, and they may be dangling in the contract.

```solidity
    function _unfarmBuyBurn(
        uint256 liquidity,
        uint256 minBoostRemove,
        uint256 minUsdRemove,
        uint256 minBoostAmountOut,
        uint256 deadline
    )
        internal
        override
        returns (uint256 boostRemoved, uint256 usdRemoved, uint256 usdAmountIn, uint256 boostAmountOut)
    {
        (uint256 amount0Min, uint256 amount1Min) = sortAmounts(minBoostRemove, minUsdRemove);
        // Remove liquidity and store the amounts of USD and BOOST tokens received
        (
            uint256 amount0FromBurn,
            uint256 amount1FromBurn,
            uint128 amount0Collected,
            uint128 amount1Collected
        ) = ISolidlyV3Pool(pool).burnAndCollect(
                address(this),
                tickLower,
                tickUpper,
                uint128(liquidity),
                amount0Min,
                amount1Min,
                type(uint128).max,
                type(uint128).max,
                deadline
            );
@>      (boostRemoved, usdRemoved) = sortAmounts(amount0FromBurn, amount1FromBurn);
        (uint256 boostCollected, uint256 usdCollected) = sortAmounts(amount0Collected, amount1Collected);

        // Ensure the BOOST amount is greater than or equal to the USD amount
        if ((boostRemoved * validRemovingRatio) / FACTOR < toBoostAmount(usdRemoved))
            revert InvalidRatioToRemoveLiquidity();

        // Approve the transfer of usd tokens to the pool
        IERC20Upgradeable(usd).approve(pool, usdRemoved);

        // Execute the swap and store the amounts of tokens involved
        (int256 amount0, int256 amount1) = ISolidlyV3Pool(pool).swap(
            address(this),
            boost > usd, // Determines if we are swapping USD for BOOST (true) or BOOST for USD (false)
@>          int256(usdRemoved),
            targetSqrtPriceX96,
            minBoostAmountOut,
            deadline
        );
        ...
    }

USD Tokens may be left in the contract after `unfarmBuyBurn()` is called.

### Mitigation

Use `amount0ToCollect`/`amount1ToCollect` instead of `amount0ToBurn`/`amount1ToBurn` for input amount when performing swaps.
