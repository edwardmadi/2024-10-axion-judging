# An attacker can frontrun `Minter.initialize()`, give `AMO_ROLE` to a contract they control, and mint unlimited BOOST tokens.

### Summary

An attacker can frontrun `Minter.initialize()`, give `AMO_ROLE` to a contract they control, and mint unlimited BOOST tokens.

### Root Cause

In [`Minter.sol:initialize()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/c65e662999d0c79439703fc6713814b4ad023e01/liquidity-amo/contracts/Minter.sol#L41-L52), there is no access control on the function call, allowing anyone to call it first by frontrunning.

[It gives the msg.sender the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/main/liquidity-amo/contracts/Minter.sol#L44), granting them the ability to call [`AccessControlUpgradeable.grantRole()`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/5ffedf46f77bed03e714913df1beff2d71611f0a/contracts/access/AccessControlUpgradeable.sol#L126-L138) and gives a contract they control the [`AMO_ROLE`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/c65e662999d0c79439703fc6713814b4ad023e01/liquidity-amo/contracts/Minter.sol#L26) needed to mint BOOST tokens with [`Minter.protocolMint()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/c65e662999d0c79439703fc6713814b4ad023e01/liquidity-amo/contracts/Minter.sol#L87-L90).

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Either the `Minter` contract needs to be deployed but not yet initialized
2. Or the `Minter` contract needs to be deployed and initialized in 2 different transactions

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Attacker monitors the mempool for the `initialize` transaction from the legitimate deployer.
2. Attacker frontruns this transaction with their own call to `initialize`, setting themselves as the admin.
3. Attacker grants a contract they control the `AMO_ROLE` to bypass the [`onlyContract`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-axion/blob/c65e662999d0c79439703fc6713814b4ad023e01/liquidity-amo/contracts/Minter.sol#L31-L34) modifier.
4. Attacker calls `protocolMint` to mint unlimited BOOST tokens. 

### Impact

The BOOST token holders suffer a complete loss of token value due to unlimited minting. The attacker gains the ability to mint an unlimited amount of BOOST tokens, effectively controlling the entire token supply and rendering the token worthless.
